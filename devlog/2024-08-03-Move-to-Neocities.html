        <p class="infbox">Alongside the full release of version 2.0, this web site has officially moved back to Neocities! Over a year ago, this web site was originally started there, but it moved to GitHub Pages after months of downtime. But thanks to Git, Ruby, and whatever CLIs are, this web site has been brought back to its former host.<br><br>The GitHub version will be taken down soon (if it can, that is), which means that <b>all</b> links to that version will be made useless and must be replaced to the Neocities link. Sorry for the hassle! I wish this whole process would've been a lot cleaner, but unfortunately, I didn't know about Git Hooks until waaaay after this site was made.<br><br>Well, now that every page is finished and ready to go, and can finally take a break from web development and go back to <i>actually making</i> my games. While this is a shorter devlog, I just wanted to get all this out there for everyone to read.<br><br>Cya, and please let me know if there are any more issues.</p>

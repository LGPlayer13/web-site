          While it may appear a bit strange to give a seemingly "minor update" its own written devlog, this particular update is quite larger and more expansive than the others from this month.<br><br>This release has a good amount of moving parts to it, so here's a semi-detailed list on what's changed around the site.<br>-----<br>- the <b>Blog Backlog</b> has been overhauled, now sorting posts by year<br><sup>- these changes were made due to the ever-growing size of the Backlog, and how out-of-control it would eventually get</sup><br>- almost every <b>Games sub-page</b> has been redesigned, providing more info on the respective games<br><sup>- the previous game pages were either boring or wasting system resources (the embeds), so they've been changed</sup><br>- a <b>new website</b> is now featured in the About page<br><sup>- i've been a fan of this creator's work ever since 2022, and now his new website is featured on <i>this</i> site!</sup><br>- minor changes to a variety of pages<br><sup>- some changes include text edits/typo fixes, layout tweaks, and minor polish</sup><br>- removed the Infinity Player+ and EggWars+ sub-pages<br><sup>- the <a href="../games/lgs-remastered-collection">Remastered Collection</a> sub-page entirely deprecates these pages' usefulness, so they've been scrubbed</sup><br>- we reached <b>200</b> unique visitors on the site!<br><sup>- this is just a fun one :)</sup><br>-----<br>Hope you all enjoy this neat little update. Take care!

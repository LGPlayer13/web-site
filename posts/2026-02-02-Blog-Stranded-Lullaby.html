                    <p>good morrow, folks. richy dude 2009 here to tell you all about LG Productions and its subsidiaries. not entirely sure where to start with his one, but i can tell you that my birthday was a smashing success at my house! even though i'm approaching the age where the phrase "moody kid" becomes outdated, i still feel two years younger. could help that i haven't actually grown much physically, but that's beside the point. one of these days i'll learn to "grow up", or something of the sort.<br>anyways, i'm feeling too young. like, it's so bad that even when i'm a senior, i'll only be chatting along with the frickin' freshmen. i'm older than literally everyone, yet i feel like the baby of the group (my castmates, btw). most people probably don't even know i'm 17, since i once again didn't bother telling anyone it was my birthday. why? who knows, i'm not exactly the most talkative person around.</p>
                    <p>since i neglected to make a birthday list this time around, my gifts consisted of a FNaF shirt (fitting), Red Dead Redemption for Nintendo Switch, and gift cards galore. at least i'm not like my dad, whose birthday comes not even <i>two weeks</i> after Christmas. i appreciated my family coming out to celebrate, especially with my cousin going through a breakup and my much younger cousin almost knocking over the PS5. can't wait for next year when they all start handing me beers like it's nothing.<br>now that it has officially been a month since the dawn of 2026, what are my new year's resolutions? well, like most kids my generation, i failed to both start and complete any of my planned resolutions. i guess my goals for this year are to... finish George 1.5? i mean, that's been my goal since 2024, and look at where we are now. in the meantime, i should probably wrap up the Remastered Collection update and work on the next Labyrinths II alpha. i'd really like to make a devlog on the former, and totally not to just pad out the list of devlog posts.</p>
                    <p>now for the moment you've all been dreading since you entered the link to this site. <b>my social life, or lack thereof.</b></p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>theatre. i'm doing that again, surprise surprise. i got a side role again, which is better than the majority of the cast. i also die off early, so i'm in the background for most of the play. i'm pretty satisfied with the role, since i don't feel like being in the spotlight again just yet. then again, that was three plays ago. maybe i'm due for something big, but beggars can't be choosers.<br>i know posts like Over the Ocean showed that i truly do enjoy theatre, but i definitely <i>don't</i> at the moment. it's just something i'm doing to keep myself busy, pretty much. look, even if i did have some friends i talked to, i'd still be staring at my schedule looking for any day where i don't have to go to rehearsal. i'm just not enjoying myself a whole lot.</p>
                    <p>sometimes i wonder how people look at me. like, when they see me on the other side of the hallway, what do they think? nothing, most likely. i rarely draw attention to myself, and whenever i do it's usually by accident. it's like i actively <i>try</i> to avoid eye contact with <b>everyone</b>. think i was ranting about crap like this in the last blog post, funnily enough. i really can't help myself from trauma dumping and sh*tting on the things i once called fun, can i?i'm just too afraid. i've had nothing but positive reactions whenever i talk to people, but i've made so little effort to facilitate reactions myself, i'm haunted by the thought of that one, eventual negative reaction.<br>to be honest, i've been thinking about it again. not that i would actually do anything related to it, but i'm just wondering how people would react. if i had to guess, it'd be something like a "oh no! anyway," kinda situation. by the time anything came of it, everyone would've already forgotten i ever talked to them in the first place. just a fleeting memory, something to bring up every so often in conversations.</p>
                    <p>heh, i'm writing this at school like the people behind me are gonna see it and say "hey, are you okay man?" maybe i am a bit of an attention seeker at times. seems i always resort to giving slight hints of my sadness instead of coming up front to someone about it. i mean, i honestly couldn't even name <i>one</i> person i could ever talk about this stuff with.<br>ever since the end of the first semester of last year, i haven't had any close friends. i probably wouldn't even be able to tell when i'm "close" with someone. last semester proved that even if i start something relatively strong with a new friend, i'll drop that friendship harder than i dropped after jumping on the couch and breaking my leg. point is, i'm lonely. this blog is the only chance i get to let all this stuff out. it's been bubbling for weeks now, and just about ready to topple over.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>but hey, i guess that's just how you feel when you get mood swings. i'm actively getting sadder as i write this, but i don't really know what else to write about. i swear, it's getting hard to write these things because of how unpredictable my mood is. all that stuff i just wrote? yeah, i only felt that a couple days ago. might feel it tomorrow or later today, who the hell knows. all i know is that i'm clearly not doing so hot!<br>i still haven't talked to anyone, i haven't been doing my homework, my head is constantly hurting, and i get disturbingly awkward and anxious around this one girl. talk about first world problems.</p>
                    <p>a part of me wants to just stop doing theatre entirely; it eats up <i>so much</i> of my time. it hurts especially for me, because i care waaaay too much about the stuff i make online. i've got a web site to update, games to play, things to stream, two games to make, one big update to finish, a CSS file to write for hyphen (sorry), and mood swings to cry about. granted, theatre is what brought me out of my freshman depression in the first place, but that was really only because of one person in particular i met there. and <i>she</i> was the one who approached <i>me</i>. meanwhile, i'm sittin' here over a year later and STILL struggling to make conversations at all.<br>i've talked to my therapist about it more, although nothing's come out of it just yet. but to be honest, it's most likely gonna end in her telling me to just stop being such a p*ssy and actually get out there. yeah, i doubt she'd use that specific language, but the same point would be given regardless. but i will say, my mom told me something recently that made me feel a bit better about myself.</p>
                    <p>she was talking to one of the parents at a weekend set building for the musical, and later told me a bit about that conversation. you know how i had a really crappy freshman year? well, turns out i'm not alone after all. two other kids turned out to have had a similarly crappy experience. no, i'm not gonna go running up to them in an attempt to bond over our shared disdain toward our high school introductory phase, but i guess it's just nice to know. makes me think back to the freshman year blog post more, and how warped my perspective really was.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>on the less awkward and anxious side of things, i feel like i actually accomplished some stuff this month. for starters, there's a <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/?g=https://file.garden/Yhwc9XZFah3TM9iw/LabStyleTest.txt" target="_blank">new style test</a> for Labyrinths II, a project which i'm quite proud of. however, there's actually <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/?g=https://file.garden/Yhwc9XZFah3TM9iw/LabStyleTest2.txt" target="_blank">a second test</a> which i made shortly after "completing" the first. to be honest, i prefer the second one a lot more, a stark contrast to what everyone else thinks.<br>but now that everyone's said how much they love the first test, i guess i'm... stuck with it? yeah, it's my fault for making two tests, but i put so much effort into the first that i couldn't <i>not</i> release it. plus, porting over all the content to the second test would've been an absolute pain.</p>
                    <p>so you're probably wondering exactly why i don't seem to like the first test very much. well, i generally prefer more "busy" layouts for games. take NeverEnding Legacy, for example. that game—which was my main inspiration for the second test—has a whole lot going on, yet manages to be clean and beautiful. the only reason i made the first test with its "floating" layout is because i wanted everything more compact, but now i've done a complete 180 and don't like it anymore.<br>i will also say that the log really isn't that important to the game anymore. it's gone from being the defining aspect of the game, to basically a bunch of flavor text. don't get me wrong, it's still rather important to the game as a whole, but not crucial. ah well, both are nice in their own right.</p>
                    <p>i've also been touching up this web site, if you haven't noticed. the same goes for my stream setup, mainly the "be right back" and "starting soon" screens. the originals were made in less than 5 minutes, and most of that was spent figuring out how to hide the background in Krita. but then i realized that i can just add a webpage as a source in OBS, and so i did.<br>a little effort later, we have a scrolling background. still looks fairly rough outside of that, but i'll work on it more in due time. i'd also like to give a (dis)honorable mention to my web design class for teaching me what "x-height" is, along with absolutely nothing else. don't worry, that class will get its own dedicated devlog post soon enough.</p>
                    <p>welp, i'm out of breath for the month. there goes another 11 kilobytes into the repo! see you soon.</p>

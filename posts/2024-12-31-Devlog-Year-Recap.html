            hello everyone! since i'm bored and can't wait another 3 days to release my next blog post, i figured i'd post an end-of-the-year devlog that basically recaps everything i did throughout the amazing year of 2024. i can't tell if this is my least productive year yet, but since i'm counting this web site as a project, that means this year was <i>slightly</i> more productive than 2023 overall. sure, we got Sid's Adventure and George 1R last year, but we got some stuff this year! right?
            <br><br>man, just bring me back to 2021 already, back when i was actually releasing stuff on a regular basis. nowadays i just release another slideshow presentation every other month. i'd prefer to release something more... interactive. like, i dunno... <b>a game</b>? what you think the "G" in my name stands for, anyway? L<u style="font-weight:bold;">Game</u>Maker13. there you have it.
            <hr>so we start off the year with... <a href="../games/lgs-remastered-collection">the Remastered Collection</a>. oh yeah... this thing. since i was an still am a <i>biiiiig</i> fan of remasters, i decided to make an entire project dedicated to them! this """complete""" package contains 3 remasters of some old classics of mine. there was also the Plus Bundle that released alongside it, which contained an update to <a href="https://turbowarp.org/628951894/">Infinity Player+</a> and the new <a href="https://turbowarp.org/1052362750/">EggWars+</a>. it even came with its own trailer, which i unfortunately neglected to put on my Youtube channel. such a missed opportunity.
            <br><br>honestly, it's probably better that the trailer never made it to my channel. the collection ended up being delayed because of... laziness? well, for whatever reason, the game was delayed from late february to early march, so about a week or two. but even <i>with</i> the delay, the collection was still unfinished, Candy Bar Clicker in particular. you couldn't even PLAY it when it was released! i eventually added it in a patch, but to this day it's STILL incomplete. will i actually finish it? probably when i'm incredibly bored one day, but don't get your hopes up. sorry, clicker game fans, your time has not yet arrived.
            <hr>soon after that, i released the <a href="../lore/lg-productions-presentation">LG Productions Presentation</a>, which had some goodies in it. firstly, it showed the intro cutscene of George 1.5, with music by the same guy who made the Sid's Adventure menu theme. secondly, it had a <b>fully-playable demo</b> of SSMB, which hadn't been seen in over a year. the demo had 9 characters, and while it doesn't include the Blitz move animatics, everything else was intact. thirdly, it was just pretty funny. the dialogue for George and Cory was very fun to write, especially some of the gags they have throughout the presentation.
            <br><br>speaking of presentations, i released <i>yet another</i> presentation a few months after that! it was a short, uninteresting one about my 4-year anniversary on Scratch. the most notable things about that project were the intro animatic and the music choice, which was an instrumental of a Radiohead song. remember when i mentioned how "nowadays i just release another slideshow presentation every other month"? yeah, this is why. i was on a roll with these things.
            <br><br>it doesn't end there, folks! because two months after that, i released ANOTHER presentation. it was the <a href="../lore/george-geography">George Lore & Geography Revisions</a>! i don't know what i was smoking these past couple months, because these were literally the ONLY things i was releasing. no games, art, nothing. just these repetitive, dull slideshows. well, dull might be a bit harsh, because at least this one had a map of the Asfard Archipelago that you could explore. see? i can be original and creative, too!
            <hr>that ends the trilogy of presentations i had this year. not a great start. and it didn't get much better from there, as all i released after that was a teaser for George 1.5 and a short (canon) animation about Cory's home life. so yeah, not a great year on Scratch. however, let's move over to the IGM side of things. i hear that i actually released a game over there!
            <br><br>before summer break ended, i wanted to get a new game out. i wasn't feeling up to making some forgettable Scratch game, so i turned to IGM for once. although i already had a project in the works, <a href="../games/fire-forge">Fire Forge</a>, i decided to start from scratch and make a simple clicker game. remembering the two Stone Mine Simulator games i'd created years before, i decided to revive the IP and make a new game. it would be the ultimate combination of everything the past two games had going for them, which wasn't much, since they were pretty terrible games.<br>after about a month, i finally released <a href="../games/sms-24">Stone Mine Simulator 2024</a>, which boasts over 100 achievements, 10 buildings, and some very impressive CSS. i'm also quite proud of the pixel art in that game, since it not only looks pretty good, but it uses spritesheets instead of individual links (which are a hassle and bad). the game got two post-launch updates soon after its initial release, and it's been dormant ever since. i'm pretty proud of this game, since it's actually good and doesn't want to make you gouge your eyes out.
            <br><br>yeah, i never got around to finishing the first Fire Forge alpha, but it's still on my agenda for next year, alongside George 1.5 and SSMB. those three projects will comprise most of my schedule for 2025, and i'm excited to share them with you all. this year <i>wasn't</i> a dud in my opinion, but it certainly could've been better. if i hadn't made this web site then i would've probably considered it a dud.
            <hr>with 2024 having come and gone, it can only get better in 2025. see you all in a few days for my upcoming blog post.
            <br><sub>it's not very uplifting but i didn't want this devlog to be all doom and gloom</sub>

        <p>yeah, sorry to disappoint you with this week's blog post, but i'm getting tired of these weekly blog posts. they're draining as hell, and scrambling to get topics to talk about every week is not a great feeling. so i'm <b>halting</b> the blog until further notice.</p>
        <p>a <i>new blog</i> is in the works, most likely using Zonelets. once this new blog is properly established, new posts will be uploaded <i>every month</i> and be written throughout the month. i may change this to every 2 months, but i'm not sure which route to go.</p>
        <p>so to wrap things up, you can read everything i've written these past 10 months in the Blog Backlog, accessible through the buttons below. hopefully this new blog will be up and running by <i>next week</i>, but don't count on it because of my lazy ass. also the George 1 trailer has been unfortunately delayed, <s>who could've seen that coming</s></p>
        <p>TL;DR : blog is paused, new blog coming soon, george trailer delayed<br><sup style="font-size:14px;color:#202020;">i don't how lazy you'd have to be to not read 9 sentences but whatever</sup></p>

        <p>i have a chemistry assignment due in an hour and a half please call it off for the love of all that is fine and dandy</p>
        <p>good evening- wait, wrong script. *ahem*, good morning. okay, i know i've been on a hot streak for the past... <i>3 months</i>, but these weekly blog posts are getting a little tiring. you might think a week gives me plenty of time to talk about mildly interesting things with minimal spelling mistakes, but that's not quite true. some weeks are just more eventful than others, and that's just kinda how it is. having to grasp and scramble for junk to write about each week gets repetitive and a little mind-numbing after a while, and it was even <i>worse</i> back when i wrote a post every... like, <b>two days</b><br>so i figured i might as well announce it now- <b>these weekly blog posts are limited.</b> eventually, i'll be making the switch to <i>montly blog posts</i>. if you're an avid reader of this blog and have kept up with site updates, it probably seems <i>really</i> annoying that i've been constantly updating and changing how the blog works. i've seen people use <a href="https://zonelets.net/" target="_blank">Zonelets</a> for blogging a lot, and it looks pretty useful. i'll most likely use that for the monthly blog posts, and i'll use some notepad doc for writing down ideas every week. does this mean blog posts will be longer? based on how much i'm writing now, yes</p>
        <p>so now that that's out of the way (man english is <i>weird</i>), i also wanna talk about this web site's new <b>halloween theme</b>! just underneath the sid theme in the list, there's a new <i>Spook</i> theme that features a dark background (on certain pages), a reddish-orange color palette, and a couple unique <i>icon variations</i>. it'll be available for a limited time until <b>November 11th</b>. and if you didn't notice, that date lines up with a blog post monday! (at least if these weekly posts are still around by then). i think the theme is pretty neat, and it's probably better than the Cory and Greg themes</p>
        <p>last weekend- well, yesterday, if that makes any sense whatsoever, i saw <b>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024)</b> with my parents. it's actually a <i>really good</i> movie, having that iconic Tim Burton-weirdness. compared to the first movie, this sequel is somehow even <i>weirder</i> than that movie, even containing some blood and gore, which is cool. very good movie, very good timing for release, good stuff all around</p>
        <p>i'm ending it here because dinner and/or homework, see you next week for some action</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fadebox extended" style="background:rgba(133,154,29,0.6);"><h3>don't get me started • 10/07/2024 • 6:34 PM PST • <u style="color:#bdec47;">Green</u></h3>
        <p>i'm not the villain, choose someone else (you don't get to)</p>
        <p>hey everyone, guess what! so last week was uneventful. shocking news, i know. but some other cool-ish stuff happened while i was existing, and i think this here blog post is a great place to talk about that stuff. i don't talk about stuff very often, despite what certain areas of the web site want you to believe. so yes, i <i>am</i> going to talk about things today. no, this is not filler. it is an abstract puzzle of sorts. incoherent ramblings ensue</p>
        <p>so <b>Minecraft "Live"</b> happened recently. being a pre-recorded broadcast, this was mojang's yearly opportunity- wait, they're happening <i>twice a year</i> now?! well that explains the pitifully sad duration. anyways, what was actually... y'know, <i>announced</i> in this thing? ...i mean, it wasn't... <i>devoid</i> of news. obviously, the best part was the villager news segment, because it was the only life imbued into this shell of a minecraft event. mojang also announced a <b>new biome and mob</b>! introducing, the <i>cracking</i>! or... the <i>freaking</i>! or... whatever name they gave to that thing. the new pale garden biome is basically a dark oak biome but grayscaled. originality, i am right? at least the mob has a neat gimmick, even if the mob itself is completely useless<br>there was also a segment about the minecraft movie but i'm not gonna bother touching upon it in-depth. to sum the whole thing up, they get it <i>right</i>, but then get it <i>wrong</i>. thank you, movie execs</p>
        <p>another thing that happened is the release of the new <b>The Smile album</b>!! led by thom yorke (radiohead's frontman), this side-project of his now has 3 studio albums under its belt. this new release, <i>Cutouts</i>, contains 10 tracks that were recorded during the <i>Wall Of Eyes</i> sessions, and never made it into that album. to be honest, this album has a very <i>haunting</i> vibe to it, which is pretty fitting, considering that it's now le spooky month. overall, the release is probably their weakest release (but not by much!), yet it's still a good listen. it has quite a few bangers, but a tad bit of unfortunate filler in some areas. i'll give it a flat 8/10</p>
        <p>alright, it's time for the LG Productions-branded <i>School Segment</i>! how exciting, yeah!!1!1! today was a weird day, because we had <i>every class</i> today. to most kids in school, that probably seems extremely... normal. but my school works on a 4-block schedule, so this was a terrible change of pace. having every class in one day is just a hassle, and it doesn't help that we only get <i>one break</i> instead of the usual two. this week is also the school's pep week, where the students get to dress up for a bunch of ""unique"" themes. today's theme was actually pretty good, mainly because it was "wear your favorite band" day and i got to wear my Vampire Weekend shirt. tomorrow is the "aloha" theme, which they do <i>every. single. year</i></p>
        <p>that's it from me, i will see you all when i get the sudden urge to write next monday<br>oh yeah the <a href="/games">Games</a> page got updated, go crazy</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fadebox extended" style="background:rgba(117,135,28,0.6);"><h3>sun structures • 9/30/2024 • 11:23 AM PST • <u style="color:#bdec47;">Green</u></h3>
        <p>this song was (briefly) featured in brooklyn nine-nine and i'm not even kidding</p>
        <p>morning everyone. we got the day off today, so that means i'm still at my house! last week was still relatively uneventful, or maybe it wasn't and i just forgot everything that happened. y'know, i should probably start taking note of important and/or notable events that happen. well, i guess i'll go through what i <i>can</i> remember. after all, i assume you're here to read up about how my life is going (or you're just really bored)</p>
        <p>my school held its <i>club rush</i> last wednesday, and we got an astonishing <b>15 whole minutes</b> to look at the... <i>31 clubs</i>!? last year there were like, 20! anyways, there was a wide range of clubs, from topics like cats and cookies, different cultures and languages, to whatever the cologne club is. i ended up joining the drama club since i'm now part of the fall production (fancy name for "the play"). my mom recommended i join the movie club, and i'm honestly considering, especially since they're gonna be watching some bangers like shrek 2 and coraline</p>
        <p>remember how during my freshman year, i always ranted about being sad and lonely? well, i think that's (<i>thankfully</i>) starting to wear thin, mainly because i've started hanging out with a group of kids that one of the kids from the play rehearsals introduced me to. wow, that sentence feels <i>incredibly</i> awkward and long. so yeah, these guys are goofy and pretty nice, and they also frequently throw things at each other. i also talked to a couple other kids from the rehearsals, and we had a pretty sincere convo about how i could possibly make more friends and become less introverted. things are looking better at school, for once</p>
        <p>so now as i'm writing this, some hyphenated man is questioning whether or not this blog post is actually real or not, and i'd like to get this thing out so i can... y'know, <i>show him</i>. although i wanna talk about one more thing before i depart for the week</p>
        <p>i plan to make the George 1R v1.1 trailer <i>very soon</i>. the update's nearing completion, and i only have a couple issues left to tidy up. no, this isn't gonna be a Scratch trailer, this will be a <b>Youtube trailer</b>. with like, <i>actual</i> editing. i'll probably look bad and janky, but it will certainly exist. this update is packed with features, changes, and fixes/optimizations, making the game 27% more playable. also, i love getting unfortunately distracted and now i completely forgot what i was gonna talk about. oh yeah, the end of this post</p>
        <p>have a nice day, have a good one, have a good day, have a day, the day was have'd</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fadebox extended" style="background:rgba(133,154,29,0.6);"><h3>meet me in september • 9/23/2024 • 6:13 PM PST • <u style="color:#bdec47;">Green</u></h3>
        <p>at the end of the trail there's another trail that's longer and goes around 20 more times</p>
        <p>good morning. i wonder how many times i've said that so far. someone count them for me. actually, i'll do it for you. including today's post, i've said "good morning" a total of <i>10 times</i>. that's crazy. anyways, last week was pretty boring. barely anything happened. the highlights were my play rehearsals, me eating bagels, and... going to BJ's restaurant. yeah, so this ends the streak of "long" blog posts. we had a good run going, i guess</p>
        <p>so this web site is currently in the middle of a <b>decently-sized</b> update, and it actually involves the <a href="/blog-backlog">Blog Backlog</a>. since the changes made to it are so drastic, this means that <i>the previous blog post will be unavailable for a short while.</i> (if you're keen on page updates, you might've noticed the "top post" button is missing!) that leaves the singular button down there pretty lonely, and i'm not exactly sure what else i could put there. i suppose i'll just leave the button there by itself, but it feels wrong not having at least 2 buttons there</p>
        <p>this upcoming update also involves a few of the <a href="/games">Games</a> sub-pages, specifically the ones for <i>George 1R</i>, <i>Sid's Adventure</i>, and the <i>IGM games</i>. instead of a game embed or a boring list of buttons, each of those pages will contain neat descriptions of what the game has to offer, even including some pictures of it to see! i'm very happy with how they look, but i just need to grab a few pictures for <i>The Lost Labyrinths</i> before it's ready to be pushed. (trust me, having to actually play your game to take pictures can take time)</p>
        <p>welp, i've basically run out of things to talk about. yeah, even with an <i>entire week</i> to do interesting things, i've still come up empty-handed for this blog post. i mean, what else is there to talk about? school? my crippling loneliness? my music taste? all of these topics are uninteresting and overused, so that pretty much wraps up this post. maybe next week i'll have more notable things to rant about? who knows for sure</p>
        <p>that's all i've got for today, goodbye for now</p>

      <div class="fadebox extended" style="background:rgba(117,135,28,0.6);"><h3>allergy weekend • 9/16/2024 • 4:03 PM PST • <u style="color:#bdec47;">Green</u></h3>
        <p>my nose is still dry, please send help</p>
        <p>hell! today i'm staying home from school. yep, not even <i>one month</i> in and i'm already taking a day off. but it's for a <i>damn good</i> reason. my allergies have once again come back to haunt me, as they've started doing these past few years especially. it usually starts with a sore throat, then transitions to a stuffy nose (to the point where you can't even <i>breathe</i>), then ends with a slight cough. but that's not all! as a parting gift for your suffering, it leaves you with a dry nose, the <b>absolute worst thing imaginable</b>. it stings, it's annoying, and you just want it gone. so these past few days have been fun</p>
        <p>you might've noticed a few new things going on with this web site. first of all, it has <b>themes</b> now! if you look at the very bottom of the page, where it says "Hate these colors?", you'll find a neat button that allows you to change the colors of this site! they're all named after the George Series/Sid's Adventure characters, but they have the actual colors shown next to them, because the majority of people probably don't know who Cory is. at the time of writing this, one the variables the code uses doesn't exactly work properly with my live preview of the web site, so idk if the actual site is showing with the colors or just with transparent boxes. if it <i>is</i> showing as the latter, i will uhh... panic</p>
        <p>as for that play i mentioned i was in last week, we've been doing a read-through of the entire script. since i'm staying home today, i had to read the second act on my own. and <i>boy</i> am i glad i did, because this story is <b>vulgar</b>. like... <i>really freaking vulgar</i>. this is the PG-13 version of the script, but with the copious amount of innuendos and f-bombs these characters say, you could honestly consider this a 17+ script. i already know there's gonna be a <i>lot</i> of re-writes</p>
        <p>i've been planning out how these last couple months are gonna go in terms of my projects, and i think i have a decent plan of how it's gonna go. starting off, i plan to release the <b>George 1 Remastered 1.1 update</b> sometime from late september to mid october. as for Fire Forge, i don't know when an alpha version will be released, but maybe i'll have something ready by late november at least? there's still a lot more to be done with that game, so its eventual release is still up in the air right now.<br>George 1.5 and SSMB are planned to both be 2025 releases, and after those are done i'll probably look into different game engines like godot or gamemaker studio. this <i>does</i> mean i'll probably leave scratch after those projects are done, especially since i don't really find enjoyment from making scratch projects anymore. plus, ever since the Codebreakers community broke up after the game released and... some drama... i haven't really interacted with a community since then.</p>
        <p>thanks for reading my blog post, stay tuned for more plog boasts</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fadebox extended" style="background:rgba(133,154,29,0.6);"><h3>the jailbroke arc • 9/9/2024 • 8:21 PM PST • <u style="color:#bdec47;">Green</u></h3>
        <p>i might end up having to tear this damn thing apart</p>
        <p>today has been relatively uneventful, aside from me trying to jailbreak my school chromebook. it all started this morning, during our second break. as i pulled up youtube, i saw an <i>advertisement</i> in the corner of my eye. as someone with with uBlock Origin (the best adblocker), this was shocking to see. i checked the extensions page only to find that <i>every extension was disabled!</i> even the ones i'd already installed! look, i get not wanting kids to install those 2048 or wordle extensions, but blocking <b>every single extension</b>?! that's no good.<br>when i got home, i started looking up how to jailbreak a chromebook. every article/website told me to enable developer mode, so i said okay. however, the key combination required to turn it on is <kbd>ESC</kbd> + <kbd>Refresh</kbd> + <kbd>Power</kbd>, and the usual power button on chromebooks was replaced with a <i>lock button</i> on this particular model</p>
        <p>this led to a series of bing searches (yes, i use bing. i don't care) that led to me a variety of "solutions" that all relied on that fateful power button. after about an hour of searching, i was out of ideas. i checked the chromebook for any usb ports, and that's when i found an odd, glowing button on the side. <i>it was the power button, located on the side for no apparent reason!</i> after getting super psyched up to finally crack this thing, i activated recovery mode and navigated to the <b>enable developer mode</b> option, then pressed enter and waited. a couple seconds of waiting later, a very loud <i>beep</i> came from... someplace on the chromebook. unfortunately for me, the screen displayed a message saying... developer mode had been <b>disabled</b>.<br>this was extremely disappointing news, so i exited recovery mode, let the system powerwash itself, then closed it. that about wraps up the <i>jailbroke arc</i>, and i'm not sure where to go from here. unless i can find a way to bypass the developer mode block, i'm stuck. how unfortunate</p>
        <p>well, that was neat, i guess. you know what else is neat? this would make for an amazing sponsor transition. anyhoo, aside from that arc i mentioned a few words ago, another mildly exciting thing happened at school today. to give me something to do during my non-existent schedule, i auditioned for my school's fall production last thursday. i had previously rehearsed some monologues the days leading up to it, so i felt prepared enough. after waiting in the performing arts center for two hours straight, it was my turn to head onto the stage. there were only two teachers there, which meant no students, thankfully. after giving it my all (or at least as much as i felt like giving in that moment), they said "thanks" and i... just headed home.<br>welp, later that evening, the callbacks were posted, and <i>my name</i> was on there. wowie! so i headed back to the same building the next day, and we all read a variety of scripts taken randomly from the actual play. i must've done <i>pretty dang well</i>, because guess what. <b>i'm in the play</b>, as a main character, no less. my parents and family were ecstatic about this news, and my mom even put some balloons on my door that somehow ended up jumpscaring me. christmas has come early for me</p>
        <p>as for game development, it has been happening. despite what the front page agenda wants you to believe, i'm actively working on PLC (post-launch content) for <a href="/games/george-series/george-1r">George 1 Remastered</a>, the remaster of my smash-hit title, George the Jumping Triangle. it'll include 1 bonus level, 2 additional cutscenes, 2 new modes, along with a variety of QOL changes here and there. i also plan to give the update its own <b>trailer</b> on youtube, so that'll be interesting to see when i get to it. until then, i'm sure my fan(s) can hardly contain their excitement</p>
        <p>that's it from me, see you all next week for even worse air quality</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fadebox extended" style="background:rgba(28,159,110,0.6);"><h3>the unimaginable mystery tour • 9/6/2024 • 6:46 PM PST • <u style="color:#47ecae;">Midway</u></h3>
        <p>be sure to watch your step, as you can't look back once you've arrived</p>
        <p>alright, so <i>before</i> i talk about what i'd like to talk about today, i should probably explain what these new-fangled <u style="color:#47ecae;">midway</u> posts are. occasionally, a topic that i <i>really</i> want to discuss will come out, and i may not want to wait until the next weekly blog post to rant about it. that's what these <b>sea green-colored</b> posts are for! they'll be much more uncommon than the usual <a style="color:#bdec47;">Green</a> posts, but don't quote me on that</p>
        <p>anyways, this midway post is focusing on the- or should i say, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY" target="_blank">A Minecraft Movie</a>" teaser trailer. released two days ago, it (unsurprisingly) reached #1 on trending for around two days straight. however, the reception was terrible. and i mean <i>terrible</i>. as of writing this, it has (reportedly) <b>1+ million</b> dislikes, compared to its 550k likes. ouch. i myself am one of those dislikes, and it <i>really</i> hurts, man. being the world's 27th biggest minecraft fan, i was pretty excited when i first heard the movie was <i>actually</i> being made. but once the leaks came out, it all went to sh*t</p>
        <p>the movie looks... well, to be blunt with you, it looks absolutely, <i>unbearably</i> atrocious. yes, my MAIN problem with this movie is the artstyle. i don't know <i>who</i> thought that f***ing MINECRAFT would translate well to "not-entirely-realistic CGI with humans awkwardly shoved in", but that decision apparently made it all the way to an official trailer. everything looks and feels off. from the humans being triple the size of the trees, to the pink sheep, to jack black being cast as """Steve""", nothing feels correct.<br>as for the plot, it's just an isekai. like, literally. the description of the trailer itself says that main characters "find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld". it's like the marketing team is saying to the consumer, "don't worry, there are no original ideas here." not to mention the whole "i... am steve" line. such a powerful line, showing that jack black isn't actually jack black in a blue shirt. no no, he's <b>Steve</b>, and you <i>know</i> it.</p>
        <p>overall, the trailer looks like ass, and everyone should apologize to story mode. cya</p>

      <div class="fadebox extended" style="background:rgba(133,154,29,0.6);"><h3>zero sum • 9/2/2024 • 10:46 AM PST • <u style="color:#bdec47;">Green</u></h3>
        <p>that's another red flag, red flag</p>
        <p>good morning everyone. oh look, it's <i>actually</i> morning this time. that's crazy. surprisingly, i'm not as tired as i usually am in the morning, probably because it's labor day and we all get the day off, which is pretty sweet. i'll be honoring this laborious day (i don't think that's the correct adjective) by watching some youtube videos or something, idk</p>
        <p>so i know i <i>said</i> i'd be working on my games "a lot more", and <i>i have</i>, don't get me wrong. but if you have a keen eye for front pages, you might've noticed that second album. that's because i released- you guessed it, <i>another album</i>! this time it's a B-sides of sorts of The S, being aptly titled <b>The S (Remixes)</b>. go check it out if you want, and see what it has to offer.<br>anyways, back to what i'm known for (i think). i've been eyeing <b>Super Scratch Melee: Blitz</b>, my previous project before George 1.5, a lot recently. it's a decently fun game, but i abandoned it entirely after shutting down George 2 for its much better, much more polished half-brother. SSMB has only 9 fighters right now, and it was planned to have around 18 or so before release. unfortunately, those last 9 fighters were never implemented, even though i've already settled on the majority of the base roster. i would love to come back to the game, but sadly, it's further down on my agenda. for now you can just play its <a href="/games/super-scratch-melee">predecessor</a>, even though it's... fairly bad</p>
        <p>for some reason, i've been listening to a certain song <i>a lot</i> recently. if you, for whatever odd reason, pay attention to my scrobbles on last.fm, you'll probably see that i've listened to <b>zero sum</b> over <i>20 times</i>. why? because it's a very song, and you should listen to said song. i've found myself listening to the smile a lot more than radiohead recently, most likely because i'm not depressed, but i still want some radiohead<i>-esque</i> music going through my eardrums. i've also been listening to nine inch nails as of recent. actually, does listening to <i>one song</i> count as listening to an entire band? probably not</p>
        <p>as for irl stuff that's going on, my cousin-in-law was supposed to host a barbeque for her birthday yesterday, but the way it was set up and planned out was quite confusing. when i first heard about it last friday, it said the bbq was being held <i>today</i> (monday). but a day later, my mom said it was being held on <i>sunday</i>. okay then. but <i>then</i>, sunday rolled around, and my mom told me it was rescheduled to 4 pm instead of 1 pm. okay... then? but <i style="font-weight:bold">then</i>, a couple hours later, it got straight-up canceled. so that's nice. my parents and i went out to chili's later though, so it was all fine and dandy</p>
        <p>so you remember how i said i was joining a debate club and/or team two weeks ago? well, guess what! <i>i dropped out!</i> after attending the first meeting, i found out how underprepared and how unviting the atmosphere was. firstly, two of the like, 8 or 9 kids were no-shows. despite the instructor brushing it off, i was thinking it didn't exactly bode well.<br>secondly, we had an introductory assignment to research and complete before the meeting started, an "easy, fun topic" to get us started, as the instructor described it. we had to write reasons for why we support and don't support pineapple on pizza for this little "intro debate" we were gonna have. so, it being an "easy, fun topic", i wrote a couple sentences and left it at that. well, when the intro debate got started, i realized that everyone else had written like, <i>3 paragraphs</i> each. like jesus, is everyone here a goddamn tryhard? i get they all have had experience, but for an "easy, fun topic", they made it seem like some college-level sh*t. we also had to critique each others' points, so it was fun sitting there and hearing them say crap like "i like how he got to the point"</p>
        <p>welp, that's it for today. see you all next week when i inevitably make The S 2</p>

        <p>school was quite the boring school, moving on now</p>
        <p>good morning everyone. i'm currently in one of those discord calls with some people. one of them is a demon, and the other one sucks at parkour. we're currently listening to minecraft parody music (along with some other garbage) as we somewhat patiently wait for one of the peoples to complete this parkour level. we were currently listening to <i>Fallen Kingdom</i>, and i had actually <i>never</i> listened to that song before. yeah, i've heard hits like "Don't Mine at Night" and "Creeper Rap", but i had somehow accidentally avoided hearing it for the longest time. and now i've heard it. hoo ray</p>
        <p>i've been working more and more on George 1.5 recently, just tidying things up, making minor engine/level improvements, and fixing some issues only i would notice. the game is <i>actually</i> being developed, not just sitting there idly on scratch's broken servers. i'll make another gameplay teaser video soon, maybe i'll show some parts of the cutscenes! i also revisited the fourth George 2 beta, and realized how absolutely bloated and atrocious it is. it's <i>probably</i> better than the third beta, but not by much</p>
        <p>i'm still in that vc i mentioned, except now it's down to three people, and we're no longer listening to minecraft parodies on loop. yay...? now we're just chatting about unmotivation, personality quizzes, and first names. decently uninteresting topics, i know.</p>
        <p>anyways, i've forgotten to share my thoughts on the new <b>foster the people</b> album! i listened to it a couple hours after it came out, and i'm extremely disappointed to report that i think the album is mid. this is such a tragic travesty. overall, the album has some great tunes, some forgettable ones, and straight-up garbage. the highlights include <i>See You In The Afterlife</i>, <i>Paradise State of Mind</i>, and <i>Chasing Low Vibrations</i><br>however, this album has a whole slew of bad/mid in it, including the masterpiece that is <i>Feed Me</i>. like man, this was supposed to be the album that i'd listen to and really enjoy to bring my sophomore year to a decent start, but it uhhh... missed. it missed big-time. oh well. at least vampire weekend and MGMT were able to bring out some bangers this year<br><sup style="font-size:14px;color:#202020;">oh hey we reached 100 unique visitors, how crazy is that</sup></p>

        <p>looks like life got lazy and just copy+pasted my freshman year as my sophomore year. hope this changes soon</p>
        <p>high. the school has started, and i'll actually try to <i>not</i> rant about it this time. all i'll say is that literally <i>nothing</i> has changed from last year. you might as well compare a day from last year and compare it to today- it looks identical. (apart from the new classes and all that.) however, i've already signed up for debate club and plan on trying out for some other stuffs, so i guess i'll just have to play it by ear</p>
        <p>anyways... back to my games and such. <b>i released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liTOlih09SA" target="_blank">gameplay trailer</a> for George 1.5!</b> it's not the most interesting thing in the world, but it does show what the game looks like and how some mechanics function. more teaser videos and announcements will come soon, but <i>progress is indeed being made</i>! as for my other projects, i'll have to see when i'm actually motivated to work on those again. i'll probably work on Fire Forge alongside G1.5, but it might take longer to get a trailer out for that game. until then, enjoy this 1.7-minute trailer for the next George Series game. <s>it only took 3 years</s></p>
        <p>summer break as a whole was fairly decent. i went to the beach, went to a theme park (twice), and managed to release something i'm actually proud of. i get it's a terribly low bar to cross, but i've been so bummed out and moody lately that i'm finding it increasingly difficult to do anything productive. can't wait until the homework starts piling up. i <i>really</i> wish i would've accomplished more stuff before it ended, but at least i got <i>something</i> done. the next few blogs are probably going to be as short as this one, mainly because my schedule is going to be a lot of "school, home, school, home, etc." and nothing really worth talking about</p>
        <p>that's it for now. hope i can fix my crippling loneliness sometime. cya</p>

        <p>one week of summer left. i'm super excited for what comes next</p>
        <p>it's been a decent summer, but unfortunately all good things come to an unfortunate end. now that i've gotten all my books and ""fixed"" my schedule, i'm ""ready"" for my next year of high school. however, there's still more school-related bullsh*t that i've had to deal with. first off, the school promised they'd be providing their own chromebooks for students to use. however, <b>they're delayed</b>, because of course they are. i don't know what clown decided to have this place provide their own chromebooks, especially considering students would almost immediately start finding loopholes and hack the hell out of those things. but it gets even better.<br>while not directly relating to <i>my</i> class, another crucial object has been delayed- the freshman locks. just like last year, the freshman class has to wait longer before being able to use the damn lockers. things just always seem to go consistently <b>wrong</b> when it comes to the beginning of school, and it looks like it's just getting worse. thanks, school</p>
        <p>secondly, my parents are actively forcing me to get and use an instagram account. if you know <i>anything</i> about my generation, social media is like an addiction, and it's arguably worse than actual drugs. because my first year was so sh*t and i was depressingly lonely, my parents (mainly my mom) think that making me get an instagram account is a great idea for curing my crippling isolation. even though i've <b>actively expressed</b> my distaste for social media (discord doesn't count), they are entirely disregarding my wishes and making me get it. i don't think a singular, garbage app is going to do <i>anything</i> for me. if i want to make friends, i'd actually want to TALK to them, not message them three times and completely forget they exist.<br>my parents said they'd have a mindset of "we'll let him make the choices he wants to make" going into high school, but it's great knowing they've already forgotten about that. they think <i>i'm</i> the stubborn one for not wanting the stupid app, but they're being complete hypocrites. i've told them before that i just <i>don't</i> connect with my generation- i'm the complete opposite. i don't like social media, i don't play sports, and i don't listen to trendy music. (it sucks ass.) this generation as a whole just sucks for a guy like me. what a time to be alive.<br>also, the only things the kids at my school do is either fight, gossip, or make out and film videos of them doing it. not very exciting.<br>also also, <b>my parents have been on social media more in a month than i've ever been in my entire life!</b></p>
        <p>man, i've gotten so pissed off that i honestly considered making this a <a style="color:#ec4747;">red</a> post. i'm <i>really</i> trying to be somewhat enthusiastic for this upcoming school year, but everything that's come before it has been such a sh*tshow that i'm fully unable to even have an iota of excitement. it's not looking good</p>
        <p>i'm ending it here. i need to eat some lunch and try to find <i>any</i> positives i can look forward to. goodbye, and sorry for the long rant<br><sup style="font-size:14px;color:#202020;">psst! i'm working on a teaser trailer for george 1.5, please hang tight</sup></p>

        <p>apparently this word doesn't exist, but it's actually a song for a game that goes hard</p>
        <p>welp, i've done it. that's right- i've officially gotten a new chair for my room. it's this sweet purple/black chair from IKEA that cost around $350. the old one i had was about to fall apart, and it basically already had. this new one is much more sturdy and is pretty damn comfortable, and it even has a reclining feature i didn't even notice before buying it. wait a minute, this wasn't what i had planned to talk about</p>
        <p>so i should probably explain the elephant in the room- <b>this web site's new look</b>! after just a couple days of coding and experimenting, this site has officially updated to version 2.0. every single page (that was kept, at least) has received a complete overhaul and a fresh new layout. my favorite by far is the <a href="/about">About</a> page, as i just love how it turned out, especially with the icons of george and cory being the cherry on top. i'm really happy with how it turned out, as i'd been a bit unhappy with the previous design for a couple months up until now<br>i should probably also mention the <i>other</i> elephant in the room, that being <b>the official switch back to Neocities</b>! yeah, this web site used to be hosted on Neocities, until i switched to the GitHub Pages version a couple months after making it. this was before i knew about Git Hooks and all that, but i did some tinkering with the command line and Git to make this entire switch possible. i want to thank <a href="https://cohost.org/ChaiaEran/post/2755172-how-to-make-using-ne" target="_blank">this post</a> for showing how it was possible to do this</p>
        <p>in other news, me and my dad recently went to my school to pick up my new schedule for the year. however, there was one error- my elective class was shown as Digital Photography instead of the one i actually wanted, Web Design. i didn't even pick photography as one of my alternatives, and to add insult to injury, <i>i didn't even meet the prerequisites for that class</i>! after my dad and i laughed about it in a café we were at, i emailed my counselor when we got home to tell her about the issue. she informed me that web design <i>was</i> available, but it, unfortunately, was at the same period as my Honors World History class. so i asked her if i could take regular WH instead to take WD, but then she told me about <i>another</i> problem<br>you see, web design is a one-semester course, and the way it usually works is that you take it the first semester, and then take Game Design the second semester. but apparently, game design was <b>unavailable</b> this year (no reason was given), and the <i>only</i> other one-semester elective i could take to fill that gap was Literature of Sport, which... i mean who the hell would actually want to take that</p>
        <p>so i decided to ask her if could take one of my alternative electives, Journalism. she recommended i take Art I instead, as "it would meet the prequisites for a lot of the classes i want to take", even though i don't even <i>know</i> what classes i wanna take next year. so i told her i wanted to take journalism instead, and i FINALLY got my finished schedule. that was a lot more of a hassle than it should've been. thanks, school</p>
        <p>well other than that, my week was pretty uneventful. other than everything i just said, i just went to my grandparents' house yesterday for breakfast, which was nice. i guess that wraps up this post, and i'll end it off by saying that SMS '24 will be releasing within the next few days, as all i have left to do is make some more pixel art. cya</p>

        <p>when the information comes, we'll know what we're made from</p>
        <p>alright, let's try to get this thing back on track. i asked my parents what day it is today, and i'm happy to report that it's <b>monday</b> instead of tuesday. i really don't know what happened last week, maybe i took a long nap at night or something and woke up too late. anyways, good morning. my week's been alright so far, with my mom <i>repeatedly</i> telling me "your assignment is due today" even though it's due in <i>three weeks</i>.<br>my parents always do this- making up their own due dates for my assignments, thinking it'll "motivate" me to finish them. that bs don't work on me, sorry to tell ya that. i could finish this thing in a week if i wanted to, and that's what i'm gonna do. sure, everyone talks about how detrimental it is to do assignments last-minute, but it's <i>summer</i>. give me a break</p>
        <p>in other news, <b>this web site is getting another facelift</b>. actually, it might be a facedown, depending on how you look at it. after getting some inspiration from other websites and tinkering with a variety of new layouts, i've settled on somthing i'm satisfied with. it might seem tiring introducing all these new designs and layouts just a couple months apart, but at least i'm not as bad as some other folks out there. in case you miss the current design, i've <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://lgplayer13.neocities.org/" target="_blank">archived</a> it on the Wayback Machine. (there's even a save from march there, too!)<br>i've always been fascinated by the concept of the WM, being this <i>massive</i> archive of the entire internet, going years and years back. i just think it's neat having my web site as a part of it</p>
        <p>i'll be releasing a <b>beta</b> version of the overhaul soon enough, and i'll gladly accept any feedback you all have through the <a href="/guestbook">Guestbook</a>. this update is so different that it'll completely skip 1.3-9 and jump straight to 2.0. yes, i <i>am</i> obsessed with version numbers. that's all for today, see you next week</p>

        <p>...it's still monday right? ...18 hours late? no, that can't be right!!!! uh oh</p>
        <p>hey guyyyyyys!! looks like i forgot about this web site one day too late! yeah, this unfortunately breaks the 'monday blog post' streak i was on for a couple weeks. sure, i was on thin ice to begin with (some were written at like 11pm), but at least it was still monday. today is <b>tuesday</b>, which just so happens to not be monday. this is why i hate mondays, along with many others</p>
        <p>i actually don't have much to talk about today. luckily for me, last week i mentioned that some blog posts may end up small, and this one is absolutely going to be a small one. i mean, i could talk about how i went to chili's today and how the burger i got was good and how they gave my dad a dirty spoon so they had to grab another one, but that doesn't sound terribly interesting now, does it</p>
        <p>i'll probably end up listing each and every reference the <i>blog splashes</i> make, just so i have another secret to put somewhere on this here site. also, apparently the <i>devlog</i> and <i>game</i> pages still had the Lore page listed, even though i removed that page in an update, so that's been fixed. okay i'm <b>really</b> grasping at straws for interesting things to talk about, so i'm just gonna end it here</p>

        <p>i'm a daft punk fan now. unfortunately, they're gone</p>
        <p>good morning. these weekly blog posts have been going pretty well, and here's one that <i>isn't</i> written at like, 10pm at night! anyhoo, i'm officially done making music for the time being, and i've solidified this by starting a new project- <b>Stone Mine Simulator 2024</b>! this is a reimagining of the past two SMS games, made in 2019 and 2022, respectively. those games were pretty bad and had awful pixel art (the first one even going as far as using stock images). this new release is basically an entire new game of its own, combining (few) elements from the past two games into one fresh, polished, definitive experience</p>
        <p>progress has been steady so far, and i'm just about to start adding the Research Tree to the game, which will be expansive and allow for some mildly interesting mechanics. it might seem weird that i'm starting a new project while i have many, <i>many</i> other projects still waiting in line. well, at its core, SMS '24 is a clicker game, which are pretty easy to make, and the "mildly interesting mechanics" earlier shouldn't take more than 3 days to add, especially considering i've already made them (two years ago, badly). i'm also usually motivated to get this project done, and i have plenty of neat ideas to keep it interesting</p>
        <p>my parents have been hogging me to start my second summer assignment lately, a three-part world history project. it involves lots of writing, writing, googling (not really, but idgaf), and... coloring? yeah, the cherry on top for this three-in-one assignment is having to color a variety of maps, not to mention having to label at least 15 locations per map. i've already gone on record stating how summer assignments are a complete joke and redundant and all that, but i <i>will</i> say that i feel completely devoid of life while doing assignments like these. summer should be a time to escape from school, not have it lingering in the back of your mind as soon as you get out of its clutches<br>it also doesn't help that my parents made me sign up for my school's debate team, which they mentioned would be "right up my alley, as i like to argue". i mean i <i>suppose</i> this is a decent opportunity, but anything that gets in the way of me following my true passion, that being game-making (despite my laziness), is likely to make me upset and miserable. who knows, maybe i'll end up making actual friends and enjoying it. but that first year was such a sh*t-show that i can't exactly get excited for anything school-related</p>
        <p>i don't think i mentioned this after getting it, but i got an MRI last month. if you don't know what that is, it's basically where a couple of doctors place you in a tube that scans your head using x-rays and magnetic fields. depending on what you're going to be scanned for, either your entire body can be placed in said tube, or just your head and a bit of your torso. i was being scanned for potential migraines that day, so i got the latter treatment. it was an incredibly weird (and <b>loud</b>) experience that i don't think i'd like to try again<br>for about 9 years now, i've been dealing with vertigo-like symptoms (which i've always just referred to as "vertigo"), those being intense dizziness and motion sickness <i>at the same time</i>. it makes simple actions like jumping and physical exercise an absolute psycological pain to endure, and every doctor i've been to up until this point has done jack to help treat it. my newest doctors thinks these symptoms are the result of migraines, which have a bit of history on my mom's side of the family. as i've never been diagnosed with anything, he suggested i get an MRI to finally get some answers<br>i go back to my neurologist in about a week or two, so hopefully he'll have some news. if he doesn't, then <a style="color:darkred">my trip to europe next year is going to be literal hell</a></p>
        <p>i will say that sometimes when i write these blog posts, i almost run out of things to talk about halfway through. because of this, i may or may not end up writing some small blog posts on some weeks. maybe you'll end up getting another <i>sit next to me</i>-level post, who knows. if that ends up happening, you already know it'll be during the school year. welp, that's it from me, have a good one</p>

        <p>was going to write one of these earlier but got a <i>little</i> sidetracked</p>
        <p>okay so the week wasn't exactly as eventful as i said it would be, but mildly interesting things still happened. for starters, my family held a july 4th party on july 3rd. makes sense, right? the party was overall fun, even though i spent the majority of it playing mariokart 8 deluxe with my cousins. the fireworks show my city had was pretty neat, even though a giant ass tree was blocking the show. i swear, that tree looks depressed and needs to be put down. however, i don't think our neighbors speak the same language.<br>i also wanna mention that last year's party ended on an... odd note. one of my cousins has a bad habit of getting insanely drunk on days like these, even to the point of being completely wasted. but this year, it was my <i>cousin-in-law</i> who got insanely drunk. how the turn tables have</p>
        <p>the next day, we went to my grandma's house (which has very nice views from her balcony) to watch illegal fireworks and eat ice cream. it was quite nice, and i even got some decent pictures that i'll be using in the near future. not a terribly eventful day, but at least no more palm trees were set ablaze</p>
        <p>the day after that, my parents and i went to a concert to see Beck (and the LA Phil, which is an orchestra). like Vampire Weekend, i only just got into Beck a couple months ago, but i know and like their songs enough to go see them live. this was actually a <i>special</i> concert, as the addition of a live orchestra allowed him to play a variety of songs that he doesn't normally get to play. most of the songs came from Sea Change and Morning Phase, which are sad, but amazing albums.<br>around 90 minutes into the show, the orchestra suddenly had to pack their bags and head out. for some reason, they're only allowed to play for around 90 minutes before heading out. after they left, Beck just played some of his big hits, like Loser and Where It's At. the performance was great overall, but there was <i>one</i> part of it i didn't like. at all</p>
        <p>while not technically part of the performance, the opening act, Jessica Pratt, was truly horrendous. i didn't even know there <i>was</i> an opening act, since it was never listed. i wish we bought some merch or something while it was happening, because <i>dear life</i> was it a pain to sit through. the music sounded extremely generic and copy+pasted, like some lofi hip/hop beats you'd find playing in a café with too much greenery. the vocals were also <i>awful</i>. the way she sings is... unique, to say the least. it also went on for an egregious <i>40 minutes</i>, not the 30 minutes opening acts are typically limited to. so that was fun</p>
        <p><sup style="font-size:14px;color:#ff0000;">spoilers for despicable me 4 up ahead</sup><br>we're still not done yet. the day after that, my cousin, parents, and i went to see despicable me 4, which had just been released in theaters. now i'm not quite the biggest fan of illumination films, but they're a big part of my childhood (the lorax especially), so i figured i might as well see the latest entry in this series. unfortunately, this movie suffered from poor pacing and too many side plots. for example, the main villain. so much time could've been spent hyping him up or seeing him track down gru and ze gorls, but no. it's spent dicking around with our main characters doing nothing for 45 minutes.<br>like, the villain has a <i>giant army of cockroaches</i>. instead of having said cockroaches act like rivals to the minions and do some cool sh*t, they do <b>absolutely nothing</b>. they're brought up once and never seen again. this movie is full of plotholes, lame jokes, and forgettable characters. good stuff</p>
        <p>btw The S comes out on the 11th, don't tell your friends or family</p>

        <p>the beginning of july is always the most eventful of the entire summer, for me at least</p>
        <p>hello everyone. this upcoming week is gonna be a <i>chore</i> to get through. i'm gonna be quite busy from wednesday all the way to saturday. not to mention, my parents now want me to really start working on my summer assignments because it's july. can i just say that summer assignments are possibly the dumbest and most frustratingly annoying thing that schools have ever forced upon students? their reasoning is that "oh these assignments are an <i>introduction</i> to the material, students <i>have to</i> learn them." no sane human being thinks that kids on summer break actually give a sh*t about learning stuff. the <b>entire</b> point of school is to <i>teach</i> you the concepts themselves, and not just pull drawn-out summer homework out of their ass.</p>
        <p>anyhoo, i finally released a new scratch project after... almost 4 months. it's a detailed update on the George Series lore and geography, which i explained would be heavily rewritten in the previous blog post. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1037737293/" target="_blank">here</a> is the project, and it will also be available in the <b>Lore & Stories</b> section of the <a href="/games">Games</a> page. not the most impressive thing in the world, but you should at be happy i'm releasing <i>something</i> at this point. maybe i should join a game jam or something, that'd probably get my creative juices flowing again, which haven't flown for quite a long time now</p>
        <p>as for <b>The S</b>, progress has been relatively steady. there's currently 9 finished tracks so far, and i'm aiming for around 13 tracks on release. i will say that this album will be <i>quite</i> long, as just three of those tracks make up 11 minutes and 30 seconds! it'll probably clock in at around 30 minutes, rivaling actual albums made by real artists. (i don't call myself a "real" artist because, well, it's sega genesis music.) after this album releases within the next two weeks, i'll take a break from composing music to focus on making games. however, i've really enjoyed what i've been able to achieve in this side hobby of mine, even if the end result isn't anything amazing<br><sup style="font-size:14px;color:#202020;">psst! i released a single a couple days ago! <a href="https://lgplayer13.bandcamp.com/track/schematics-2" target="_blank">here it is</a>!</sup></p>
        <p>one thing i wish won't happen in the future is that these blog posts will end up just talking about the same three projects over and <i>over</i> again. for example, i've talked about my new album twice in a row now, and i get it can be a little tiresome for readers. yeah, it's <i>my</i> blog, so i can literally just ramble about nothing for as long as i desire, but it makes for repetitive blog posts and sluggish, boring reads. luckily for me, this week is gonna be <i>really</i> eventful, so my next post should be more unique and interesting than this one. in the meantime, have a good rest of your morning</p>

        <p>hey look, i actually followed through with last week's promise</p>
        <p>good morning everyone. last week was much less eventful than the week that came before it, so i guess i'll talk more about my current and upcoming projects. in case you're wondering whether Thirteen was the only album i'd ever make, you're dead wrong. at this very moment, i'm producing a <i>second</i> album, and it's called <b>The S</b>. there's only 6 complete songs on it right now, but i plan on having around 12-15 tracks packed into this new release. when will it come out? don't bother asking, because the answer won't be here for a while. a single or two may be released later</p>
        <p>in terms of game-making, production on Fire Forge has been picking up. i have lots of new ideas for some of the quests that are gonna be featured in the first alpha, and my pixel art skills are definitely improving, little by little. i know i said it would hopefully release mid-june, but if you haven't noticed, it's basically <i>late-june</i>. now the release has been delayed to When It's Ready™. i <i>will</i>, however, make a trailer for the game when i have enough gameplay to show. i'll probably also compose a song for said trailer, unless someone else makes it for me</p>
        <p>on another note, my previous IGM game, The Lost Labyrinths, was actually featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt_FEKCdapc" target="_blank">new video</a> by IronDizaster, a prominent member of the IGM community. i kinda wish the game wasn't in such an odd (and, well... kinda bad) state right now, but it is what it is, i guess. however, i'm still proud of that game and managing to make a game that rivals Forez's Dream (which was <i>also</i> shown in the same vid)</p>
        <p>as for the George series, i've been working on PLC (post-launch content, it wouldn't make sense to call it DLC) for George 1 Remastered. it'll add 3 new modes to play around with, those being <b>Level 6</b>, <b>Speedrun Mode</b>, and <b>Endless Mode</b>. i won't go in detail as to what they're all about, since i'd like you to experience those modes for yourself. i know it's been <i>over a year</i> since the game released, but "better late than never", as they say. in the meantime, i'll be releasing a project detailing some new stuff i've written and made for the lore of the series, which is going through some major overhauls and re-writes<br><sup style="font-size:14px;color:#202020;">psst! the title of this post is actually the name of a song on the album i mentioned above!</sup></p>

        <p>just checked my two summer assignments today, they are quite the doozy</p>
        <p>well, it's been a while. longer than usual. luckily for me and all of you, it's summer break now, and i've already done quite a lot of stuff. the first thing i've decided to do is change the schedule for blog posts. they currently just kinda come out at random, usually taking 5-7 days each. however, i'm now starting a <b>weekly</b> blog post schedule, with a new post being written every monday. originally it was going to be every sunday, but i forgot to write one yesterday. also, the time each blog post comes out will continue to be random. i get 11 pm is slightly pushing it, but it still counts</p>
        <p>five days ago, i went to my first <i>real</i> concert. the reason i put <i>real</i> in there is because i previously went to a... ugh... a kidz bop concert many years ago, but i'm not counting that since all they do is covers. this time i went with my dad and his friend to see vampire weekend at the hollywood bowl. in just four short months i've already become a <i>big</i> fan of the group, and i even bought a shirt before the show started. the two opening groups were voodoo glow skulls (who weren't exactly my cup of tea) and the english beat (who were pretty cool, but their performance was surprisingly short)<br>anyways, ezra and the guys started at around 8 pm, and it was literally <i>just them</i> playing the first three songs, which was actually pretty neat. then they played ice cream piano, and the giant sheet behind them fell, revealing the rest of the live band. i honestly cried at that moment, probably because the whole experience and music were absolutely phenomenal. some surprise plays were the surfer, sympathy, and ladies of cambridge. there were even ska-ified versions of ottoman and giving up the gun that were played, which was neat. overall, their performance was a perfect 10/10</p>
        <p>two days ago, my family had a father's day barbeque at my house. it was entirely my grandpa's idea, even though the rest of us thought it would be <i>waaaay</i> easier to just go to a restaurant or something. despite this, we still went through with my grandpa's plan. unfortunately, the grill my nino has was found to be too difficult to bring to my backyard (even though we live <b>right next to each other</b>). so it was more like us just having lunch together. the day was mostly fine, but my baby cousin has recently taken a liking to a graduation picture of mine, and he's <i>always</i> repeating my name out loud, which, of course, the family adores.<br>now i don't know if you know this, but "moody teenager" and "baby" do <i>not</i> match. it was deeply frustrating and annoying hearing the kid just say my name over and over, with the family expecting me to react every time. sheesh. my dad was also like, "stop acting like a jerk, we're trying to teach him". okay, teach him <i>what</i> exactly? to repeat his uncle's name over and over? also, i wasn't scowling at the kid or anything, i was literally just sitting there. is sitting down and not paying attention 24/7 suddenly a <i>bad thing</i>? so yeah, fun day</p>
        <p>remember the double smp (or as it was officially called, the smp smp)? no? well, now there's a sequel- the stupid smp, or as i like to call it, the "lack of good sense or judgment smp". one mod in particular has intrigued me quite a bit, that mod being pneumaticcraft. it's a tech mod where you utilize compressed air, heat, and funny liquids to make cool contraptions and machines. it's the first tech mod i've learned a "decent" amount of while having fun doing it. anyways, expect a video on the stupid smp from me at some point. i know i said i'd make a chirpy reverie video beforehand, but i haven't bothered editing it yet, sorry 'bout that</p>

      <div class="fadebox extended" style="background:rgba(133,154,29,0.6);"><h3>the freshman year review: let down • 6/6/2024 • 11:12 AM PST • <u style="color:#bdec47;">Green?</u></h3>
        <p><a style="color:#ff0000;">⚠ Post may be slightly less "green" then usual.</a></p>
        <p>good morning, everyone. yesterday was my last day of my freshman year of high school, and i have quite a lot to say about it. no, this won't include anything about finals, because the finals were relatively easy to sit through compared to the rest of the year. with that out of the way, watch me lay out how this first year was a complete let down.</p>
        <p>after graduating from 8th grade, i was fairly interested and even a bit excited for high school. it seemed like a fun and enthralling experience at the time, and i was "just about ready" to move on from my tiny private school to a <i>much</i> larger high school. well, that motivation and excitement died off two weeks in. yes, it took just two weeks to kill my enthusiasm. either my private school was absolute sh*t at preparing me for high school, or my introverted lifestyle just got the better of me, but i quickly found out that high school was no fun. <b>at all</b>.</p>
        <p>i'm not gonna go into how i feel that school as a whole is a complete joke and waste of my time and energy, but i figured i should mention it for the sake of this blog post. anyways, some issue i had with high school rose up almost immediately. first up, my spanish and honors algebra classes. my spanish class was fine for like, the first month, but after that the homework started to become <i>insanely</i> hard, and it would take me literal <i>hours</i> to wrap up.<br>now, i usually do my homework, but this was crossing the line for me. i have an actual life to live, and i'm a firm believer that anything related to schoolwork should stay where it belongs (in school). this is why homework just doesn't work; it places extra pressure on students who struggle in class to keep up and causes their grades to plummet. instead of trying to motivate them to study and work hard, they get a bunch of work thrown in their face and are expected to finish it when they don't even know how to do it in the first place.</p>
        <p>this wasn't exclusive to spanish, my honors algebra class also had this problem. in that class, we had to rush through <i>two</i> lessons per day, and we had chapter tests basically every other week. the balance of class to work was nonexistent, and i found it extremely, <i>extremely</i> hard to keep up. also, the teacher was rude and cranky all the time, so that didn't exactly help the class all too much. yeah, we had this 20-pound math book to help us out, but this book in particular did a sh*t job at actually teaching readers how to do the problems, as it just gave a couple example problems and then said, "you're on your own, f**ker".<br>the homework and lessons were overwhelming, to say the least, and this actually caused me to transfer to regular algebra my second semester. these two classes combined with all the other high school bullsh*t caused my mood to suffer greatly, and it was quickly affecting me mentally and socially.</p>
        <p>i'm not gonna blame my nonexistent social life on high school itself. no, it was my fault. i'm extremely introverted and shy, and i was very intimidated to try and talk to people. i joined two clubs to try and meet new people at the start of the year, but they ultimately proved fruitless. one of the clubs was basically just full of juniors and seniors, who were a bit out of range for me. the other <i>also</i> just had people outside my age group, not to mention that this club was utter sh*t at informing members when meetings were scheduled. instead of oh, i don't know, <b>emailing</b> members, it relied on the morning school announcements (over the intercom) to let us know when to meet up.<br>this is probably the <i>worst</i> way to let anyone know of club meetings, for a variety of reasons. first of all, sometimes i had PE/health in the morning, where we're <i>outside</i>, making it very difficult to hear what's being announced. second of all, our club meetings were like, <i>every two months</i>. why even bother making a goddamn club in the first place if its meetings are <b>every two f**king months</b>?! overall, these two clubs did jack to help my social life, and it felt like a chore just going.</p>
        <p>so because of the terrible clubs and my shy nature, i basically had zero friends throughout the school year. even though a handful of my classmates from 8th grade attended the same school, we quickly drifted apart (mainly me from them). i did try to hang out with a couple of their new friend groups, but it was useless, as i don't have <i>anything</i> in common with basically anyone. i don't have any social media outside discord, i don't like modern/trendy music, and i don't play sports. if you don't have any of those things going into high school, it won't be fun. and i learned that the hard way.</p>
        <p>my mental health quickly fell farther than it'd ever had, and by february, you could've even considered me depressed. the combination of no friends, excessive homework, and just plain hating school dragged my life and mood down the drain, and i felt dead inside. high school was ruining my life, and there was nothing i could do except sit and watch. this is why i talk about my music taste so much, as it was all i had, along with my relatively small online social life.</p>
        <p>going into march, i started to meet with a wellness counselor at my school, who taught me how to handle my emotions properly. it was the first bit of comfort i had felt in a long while, and i <i>really</i> needed it. my new algebra class was fine, it was a lot more manageable and it wasn't cold. however, my honors biology class had to be moved to 4th period, which just so happened to be a lot worse than the 1st period class. it involved lots of girls (popular and utterly annoying girls), screaming, and terrible music, which is all i'll say. so that was a nice bonus.</p>
        <p>as high school was coming closer and closer to finally ending, my grades were starting to slip. i had missed a bit more class than usual, as i was especially prone to being sick this year. i was missing homework and even some tests, and my grades were dying in front of my very eyes. after giving up precious game development time to focus on homework, my grades picked up a little bit, and i managed to keep them at A's and B's. i love giving up what i love to focus on f**king letters on a piece of paper. what a wonderous life we live in.<br>brief note: whenever i try to express my feelings on how i think school is a waste of time to my parents, they're always like "b-but no you don't understand! you <i>have</i> to take your spanish class because it's important for college, your main goal in life!" can i just say that i <i>despise</i> this way of thinking? college is <b>not</b> my goal in life. hell, i couldn't give two sh*ts about college. my goal in life is to pursue the things <i>i</i> want to do, achieve the goals <i>i</i> want to achieve, not some stupid pre-set goals that barely amount to anything.</p>
        <p>near the end of may, i decided to make an album after my motivation for game-making had plummeted. the overall theme of this album is how my mood towards high school progressed throughout the year. this project turned into <a href="https://lgplayer13.bandcamp.com/album/thirteen" target="_blank">Thirteen</a>, my first album. this web site was also made to fill a void in my life that had started to grow ever since 8th grade had ended. i hate school. i really, <i>really</i> do, especially now. school means jacksh*t to me compared to what i've been able to achieve on my own time.</p>
        <p>overall, my freshman year of high school was a complete let down, and i'm not exactly very happy that i still have another 3 years to trudge through. however, i've learned how to adapt in high school, but i still need to figure out how to, or even if i <i>can</i>, thrive in it. i have a different mindset going into next year, that being to try out for different extracurriculars (can i just say i don't like that term? it makes everything seem <i>less fun</i> and more like a chore) and attempt to interact with the people in my classes more. hopefully next year can change my mind about high school. but for now, the future is looking bleak. summer is my saving grace, and i hope i can achieve more fulfilling things now.</p>

        <p>the discs have been cancelled now, similar to me a couple months ago</p>
        <p><b>i have a bandcamp page</b> now! it'll host all future singles and albums i compose, including ones that've already been made. as for the <u>discs</u>, that complicates things. the <u>discs</u> were supposed to be some arg, which would reveal a story as more songs got released. however, i promised to make 10 of those things, which is quite beyond what i'm capable of, similar to how i planned out Sid's Adventure. so now i'm officially shutting down the discs (no more underlining), and all references and pages related to them have been deleted. the scratch account hosting them will be terminated soon</p>
        <p>i've already uploaded a few unreleased singles and the songs from the <i>Georg1e EP</i>, now renamed to <i>First Draft</i>. it also has a few more unreleased tracks that i made for the third disc. they're not good, but they are indeed there. however, i am working on a new <b>album</b> that will utilize the sweet sega genesis soundchip instead of the limited NES soundchip. a single will be uploaded later, hopefully within the day. until the album is complete (which shouldn't take long), i'll work on getting some more songs composed</p>
        <p>school is ending in eight days, which happens to be june 5th. my teachers are currently reviewing for our final exams, and the two i'm most worried about are algebra and spanish. when it comes to algebra, i'm pretty alright at it, but trying to actually <i>remember</i> the lessons is what gets me. i've mentioned before that school is just a glorified memory test, with extracurriculars thrown together on the side to make it seem "fun" and "enjoyable". that's bullsh*t. school is tedious, boring, and it makes me depressed. i can't stand the thought of having to put up with this crap for another three f***ing years</p>
        <p>okay... i'm losing focus. uh... so yeah, trying to remember the lessons i'm being taught is quite difficult, and algebra is no exception. as for spanish, i'm just not good at spanish. i hate to tell you this, but <i>no hablo en español</i>. don't try forcing it down my throat. also, the homework takes <i>forever</i> to do, which is why i have a feeling that 'B' i have isn't gonna last very long. these last few days are gonna make or break me</p>
        <p>welp, my monthly school rant is over. time for actually fun topics! i'm quite interested in <b>streaming on twitch</b>, which i'm sure i've said before. i'm looking into some tutorials and slightly better equipment (a stand-up mic) to get set up. what my first stream will consist of i'm not sure, but it'll probably just be some BTA gameplay or something. when it comes to G1.5 and SSMB, i'm dedicating my summer to developing them. while i probably won't finish them, i'll have enough time to make good progress and get farther than i've ever gotten before. in the meantime, i hope you enjoy what i'm putting out now, even if it doesn't seem like much</p>

        <p>being cramped on a bench with other kids you barely know is <i>just</i> the most fun ever</p>
        <p>writing this at school today. usually in my health class we'd sit on the lunch tables outside, where we have personal space and quiet. however, the teacher didn't take his don't-be-a-jackass pills today, so he just dumped us in the gym. now i'm sitting next to the students i'd want to sit next to the <i>least</i>. if you're wondering why i'd rather sit next to literally <i>anyone else</i>, all these particular students do is watch brainrot and cause me immense uncomfortableness. so yeah, my day is going well</p>
        <p>this week has been rather uneventful in terms of game development, but i've got a couple new ideas for videos i could make. i mainly want to make a <b>chirpy reverie</b> video and an <b>animal well</b> video. i haven't bought animal well yet, but it looks fun and it could make for an interesting blind playthrough. as for when i'll act on these ideas, i'm hoping to record something within the next few days. i haven't played chirpy reverie in quite a while, but i'm pretty excited to revisit it soon</p>
        <p>for some reason, i've been thinking a lot about what a future album of mine would look like. no, this does <i>not</i> mean i'll be attempting to enter the music industry anytime soon, but i think making an album (or at least an EP) would be pretty cool. if i ever did make one, i'd probably call it something like "The Isolated Hours" or something like that. oh yeah, if you can connect the dots on what the title relates to, you win a gold star. in the meantime, however, i'll stick to what's important- George 1.5.</p>
        <p>speaking of George, i recently updated the <i>geography</i> of Asfard <s>Island</s> Archipelago, the place the series takes place on. i'll probably make a Scratch project talking about it at some point, but that might take a bit. what i've made so far is just a <i>rough draft</i>, and it's not even in color. the reason for updating the island (now archipelago) in the first place is because i was running out of space to put more levels on the island. i didn't want to have to move this game to another island entirely, so i decided to transform Asfard into a new place entirely, even with some new toponyms! more updates soon. cya</p>

        <p>well that wasn't very fun at all. <i>*cough*</i></p>
        <p>i got covid. yeah, remember that virus people kept talking about until some other crap happened and everyone forgot? i got that <i>four years later</i>, and i'm still pretty shocked i got it at all. luckily for me, i have all my vaccines, boosters, and all that jazz, so i knew i wasn't about to perish or anything like that. still, the experience was less than stellar. it included such riveting symptoms as stomach pains (for a single night?), stuffy nose, immense fevers, loss of appetite, and lots of freaking gatorade. orange gatorade. there's still one on my desk...</p>
        <p>while i still have the virus within me, its effects have almost entirely disappeared, and i'm hoping i can rid of it entirely by tomorrow because my godparents are throwing a neat party. the best part about this was that i got to skip 4 (not counting weekend) days of school. bet you weren't expecting <i>that</i>, weren't you? anyways, my spirits are slightly more up than usual and i'm more than ready to throw in the towel. high school has been a fairly miserable experience that i'm super excited to have to endure 3 more years of</p>
        <p>all i've been doing recently are listening to more depressing music and working a bit on FF and G1.5. for you Radiohead fans out there, i'm very sorry to tell you that <i>The King Of Limbs</i> is one of my favorite albums. not that i don't really like their more popular albums, i just really enjoy TKOL's unique, yet short-lived sound<br>in terms of more real life stuff, i'm getting into Wii Sports again. of all the fun games out there i could've gotten into, it just had to be Wii freaking Sports. at some point in time, i actually jailbroke my Wii, but there was a slight issue. i used a <b>flash drive</b> instead of a <b>hard drive</b>, which is a big no-no when it comes to Wii modding. i had to suffer through many corruptions and crashes while modding the thing, not to mention the very frustrating internet connection issues. my Wii just <i>despises</i> the 5G wifi in our house and has found a new hobby of throwing error codes at my face</p>
        <p>the problem with playing Wii Sports tennis and baseball for hours straight as George the Triangle is that your arm gets sore. like, <i>really</i> sore. for an entire day. well, maybe your arm wouldn't start wishing for its own death in that situation, but mine sure did. man, i am running out of things to talk about here. goods bye to you alls</p>

        <p>the last one out of the box, the last one who broke the spell</p>
        <p>this is the first blog post of mine to be split into different <i>parts</i>, since the title is both a song reference and three blog posts in one, how neat! <b>the horrible server</b> is referring to the Cambrian and Logdam SMPs, which i happen to have a bit of history with. <b>testday</b> refers to an AP exam i took, as i have quite a few thoughts on it. <b>barebones</b> is referring to project development as a whole, and how not-very-swell it's been going recently</p>
        <hr>
        <p><u>May 7th</u> : back in the wonderous year of 2022, a user called <i>Super</i> on the Dashnet Forums created a neat IGM game. it had great pixel art was fairly unique, so me and a couple others became invested in the game's development. soon enough, Super created an entire discord server for the game, and it was called <i>Cambrian</i>. after some more devlopment shenanigans occurred, a <i>Minecraft SMP</i> came to fruition out of the blue. despite this, everyone was supportive, and the smp was started.</p>
        <p>it was all fun and games until the third day came. Super had invited a particular individual to the server who he'd had a lengthy history with, and not a good one. the <b>rabbit</b> was known for tryharding on every server he was on, demanding control over everyone for his overdramatic youtube videos. well this was no different; he and his friends (who had infiltrated the server on hidden accounts) got OP gear and witherbombed the entire server. there <i>was</i> a short 2-minute video made by the guy himself, but it was lost after he switched accounts.</p>
        <p>Super decided to start a second season of the smp, even though everyone was still on edge from that last one. anyways, this season was relatively successful for the short time it was up, and i actually teamed up with a couple people this time, instead of travelling 2,000 blocks away and being isolated. for <i>some f***ing reason</i>, Super decided to invite the <b>rabbit</b> to the server AGAIN. after they grinded for OP gear again, our base coords got leaked and it was soon invaded. the <b>rabbit</b> and his cohorts intimidated us at the base for a while before it all came crashing down in a withery inferno.</p>
        <p>after this, it was over and done. Super abandoned his projects and the SMP, and the majority of people ended up leaving Cambrian for good. however, i decided to stick around with the <b>rabbit</b>, as i was intrigued by where this whole smp thing would go next. now entering: the <i>Logdam SMP</i>. this smp had gone through tons of seasons and events previously, and apparently now was a great time for a new installment.</p>
        <p>once the launch event was finished and everyone was starting off, i teamed up with some really cool people (not the <b>rabbit</b> btw) and we had a nice village set up, even with its own McDonalds, made by yours truly. however, the <b>rabbit</b>, being himself, found our base coords by cheating or something and payed a nice visit to our village. after some back-and-forth'ing and a lot of intimidation, me and one of my basemates were just sick of this guy's sh*t, so we quit.</p>
        <p>...and that is where my affiliation with those SMPs concluded. the final Logdam SMP season actually has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEGUxhY9hrY" target="_blank">mid video</a> highlighting some of the events mentioned here. go watch it, even though it's bad and overdramatic. also can i just mention that the guy sounds <i>exactly</i> like wilbur soot</p>
        <hr>
        <p><u>May 8th</u> : yesterday i took an AP test, which is a <i>long</i> exam that jumbles everything you learned for the past 9 months and makes you recite very specific parts of it. in case you didn't know, AP tests are graded on a 1-5 scale, with 3 being the minimum to have "passed" the exam. i know i said i have "quite a few thoughs on it", but it really won't be that long.</p>
        <p>everyone was extremely nervous for the test in the morning, and i'm not sure if those donuts and chocolate milk helped. the room we took the test in was surprisingly nice, probably because they had the windows open. the exam itself took around 3 hours, being split into 2 distinct parts that test your <s>knowledge</s> ability to memorize junk well. i don't think i did absolutely amazing on the test, but literally everyone has the mindset of "oh boy i hope i at least get a 3".</p>
        <p>i guess it was a nice change of pace from the monotonous schedule we always go through, and we even got to go home early, if we wanted to that is. if you think i stayed then you are absolutely wrong and should consult a doctor. welp, guess there's nothing left to do except wait until july for the results. yes, it takes <i>that long</i> to get the results. i guess i don't blame them, going through hundreds of hand-written essays must be quite a chore.</p>
        <p>there's this one kid in my class with a condition or something that makes him cough a lot, and it didn't help that he felt congested that day. i'm really glad that i wasn't forced to sit next to him, since your seat in the AP test room is chosen randomly. i pray for the poor soul who had to sit next to that guy.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><u>May 9th</u> : game development has been quite slow as of recent. my "depressed" state has come back to haunt me, and i haven't been motivated to do much. sure, this web site has been blossoming quite nicely, but i need to focus on my games. y'know, the stuff i'm <i>known</i> for? after i made lots of progress on Fire Forge last month, i've kinda dropped the ball.</p>
        <p>as for George 1.5, i just haven't bothered working on it much at all. the stuff i <i>have</i> worked on is... not exactly good for overall progression. i already have an idea for the <i>credits</i> scene, which isn't exactly a good thing when not even the second freaking level is done. to help myself through this, i'm gonna start writing down the story on some document so i at least have something to refer to when writing the story.</p>
        <p>starting yesterday, my vertigo decided to pay me a little visit and cause me to have a little panic attack of sorts. if you haven't heard, vertigo is basically dizziness and motion sickness combined, resulting in a truly awful living experience. today i went to the doctor's office and finally got some closure on what the hell is wrong with me, as my previous doctors have done jacksh*t. he said it might be something to do with migraines, so that's pretty swag.</p>
        <p>hoping to get this all resolved by the end of summer. i'd really like for Fire Forge and George 1.5 to released by the end of this year, since i know that high school is gonna keep getting worse and harder on my sanity. sorry if this portion of the blog post isn't exactly as "<a style="color:#bdec47;text-shadow:1px 1px 3px #000000;">Green</a>" as the others, but i need to get this off my chest.</p>

        <p>i should be studying for an AP test rn, but i have better and much more fun things to do</p>
        <p>my dad is expecting a fully completed practice FRQ (free-response question) by the time he gets home, but there's only like a 40% chance it'll be done. anyways, i visited my grandparents an hour ago, and it was quite nice. i don't see them often, so hopefully i'll get to hang with them more this summer. since i'm mostly likely not taking summer school, i'll also be able to get much more progress done on my current projects, like Fire Forge and George 1.5</p>
        <p>now that i've finally discovered the joys of using <i>height:auto;</i> i can finally not have to worry about sizing issues. however, that kinda eliminates the whole "short/long/longer blog" thing, since now blogs can be as long as they want, even longer than those <a style="color:#1eb584;">longer</a> blog posts. i may also switch to <i>weekly</i> blog posts instead of 1 to 2 a week. i don't know, maybe i could release a post every saturday. a week should be plenty of time for me to come up with things to write about. it was especially hard when i still released posts every 2-3 days. welp, i've made up my mind; the "short/long/longer" labels are being abolished, in favor of writing however much i want<br>i could also give each blog post its own page thanks to my second discovery, <b>folders</b>. i might consider this in the future, but the Blog Backlog is staying for now</p>
        <p>i wonder how long it would feasibly take someone to read through my entire blog. yea, it's less than 5 months old, but i think there's enough material to keep someone reading for a decently long while. this just popped in my head; what if i gave each post its own <i>tag</i> specifying what it's about? well, there's multiple problems with that right off the bat. first off, these blogs aren't really about... anything. second, we already have the color-coded system for the mood of a blog. plus, the last time i used a color other than green was with The Post Who Shall Not Be Named</p>
        <p>my youtube hobby has become quite dormant ever since the Terraria 1.0.6.4 video, that's mainly because i've been obsessively working on this web site and my games, which doesn't make for great videos. instead, i'm gonna look into <b>streaming on Twitch</b> sometime. i already <i>have</i> an account, but i haven't exactly done much with it. my streams will consist of gaming, game-making, and maybe some other random stuff. i haven't bothered watching any tutorials or setting up a schedule at all, but i am still interested in doing so</p>

        <p>out of all the minecraft update names, this one is probably the worst</p>
        <p>good morning, i'm writing a blog post. anyways, today i felt unreasonably happy. i'm pretty sure i was happy because it's the end of the week and school is no more for two days. well, that last part is a bit of a lie because i'm participating in this "footprints" walk event. the way it works is you walk a couple laps around a big ol' track for some "christian service hours", which are one of the worst and most annoying school-related things to exist, alongside homework</p>
        <p>while chilling on my usual bench at the previously-mentioned school, i check out mojang's <i>minecraft monthly</i> series's latest episode, which actually revealed the name for mc 1.21! the name chosen was "tricky trials", which i and many others agree is pretty mid. at least 1.20 followed the [feature] & [feature] naming scheme, but this one doesn't, making it feel off. i think the trial chambers and the new mobs are honestly really neat (even though i haven't played a single snapshot), but it's just the name that rubs me the wrong way</p>
        <p>fire forge development is going pretty well, i've close to wrapping up the <i>cooking</i> mechanic for the third quest. i must also give a shout-out to lexal for becoming an official-ish playtester for the game, pointing out inconsistencies and errors while providing very helpful feedback. the launch of the first alpha version will likely contain anywhere from 8-10 quests, but don't let that fool you. these quests are <i>quite</i> long, and introduce mechanics that probably each require a tutorial. it's safe to say those quests will keep you busy</p>
        <p>i might as well take some time to talk about some minor updates i have made/plan to make on this web site. one change you probably haven't noticed is the addition of the <a href="/games/fire-forge">fire forge page</a> and an overhaul to the <a href="/games/the-lost-labyrinths">lost labyrinths page</a>. the original page was very bland and empty, so i've added some icons and new links to it. as for any other future updates, i don't have anything else really planned. but i <i>am</i> open to featuring other websites in the <a href="/about">about page</a>! feel free to suggest one via my discord server or the guestbook</p>

        <p>i'm so glad my high school (they're very high indeed) has given us soundcloud rapper #81729361</p>
        <p>today my school had its last rally, and they wanted to go out with a bang, even though they actually ended up going out with a pop. this was a "student class competition", where each class had pre-determined students go up and compete for the title of [insert title here]. like usual, the seniors ended up winning, and the best part about my day was leaving. however, there was one <i>crucial</i> moment in the rally where a particular student went down to the middle of the gym and performed. it wasn't great, i'll say that right off the bat</p>
        <p>for some context, a "new and upcoming rapper" had recently gotten a name for himself in my school, even being featured in one of its weekly news video things. well this guy is apparently more popular than i thought, because he was invited to perform one of his songs from his album during the rally. after the sounds of the many screams destroyed my eardrums, the guy waddled his way down and started rapping along to his song. in case i haven't mentioned it before, i just plain don't like rap, and this guy wasn't exactly changing my mind</p>
        <p>straying away from that topic, i've started up development of <b>Fire Forge</b> again! this will be my next igm game after The Lost Labyrinths, and it's gonna be quite different. this game is a text-based, story-driven, tech-based game. not many igm games feature stories, and those that <i>have</i> stories don't exactly have... well, <i>proper</i> stories. the premise of FF will be You, the main character, asking your Friend to come over and help you burn stuff to make more complex stuff</p>
        <p>the gameplay will be... lots of clicking, like usual. but as you progress through the story and complete more quests, more mechanics and features will be introduced over time to keep the fire going. (get it?) i'm hoping to have the first alpha released in may or june, with the first 8-10 quests, along with some side stuff. there'll also be <i>over 300</i> unique topics that You and your Friend can discuss for the Friendship system, which will be discussed later. for now, expect some new teasers to be posted on my discord server</p>

        <p>the web site looks different, so now i'm going to file a noise complaint</p>
        <p>good morning every one. after doing lots of thinking and back-and-forth-ing, i've decided to move to Brackets for future web site development. to learn why, read <a href="/devlog/2024-04-14-Web-Site-1_2">this</a>. now that the web site has updated to version 1.2 in the span of less than three days, i should probably run you through what's been changed, removed, and added. alright time for professional moment: <i>i think this new update will provide a smoother browsing experience for all of our viewers and loyal subscribers, as this company is strictly satisfaction-oriented</i></p>
        <p>first things first, the little bar below the Navbar (the one with the all the icons) has been removed in favor of the <a href="/socials">Socials</a> page. i've been thinking that the little bar looks ugly for a while now, so i'm glad it's been trashed. next up, <i>most</i> of the gray boxes containing information for each page have been removed and replaced with tinier bars that get straight to the point- the title of the page. this web site used to use the color gray waaaay to much, so i'm glad to make this web site more colorful and lively</p>
        <p>the Updates page no longer uses plain text for every update, but instead every major project/web site update will have its own neat box (with an icon!) that quickly tells you what's new. each one will even have its own <b>devlog</b> linked with it! minor updates will get their own box, too, but they won't have an icon or devlog, sadly. the Socials page also uses a similar system, but instead of linking you to a devlog, they just send you to their respective websites</p>
        <p>as for removed stuff, the Blog-3, Cory Lore, CSS Previewing, George Lore, and Youtube Channel pages have all been terminated. some of these pages were outdated and useless, some were just plain useless, and one of them was a new employee that didn't fit well with the others. every other page has been saved and updated, but you might find them in different spots. you probably didn't even know some of those pages existed, and i'm not sure why i kept them for so long</p>
        <p>alright, enough web site blabber. it's time for actual blog talking. school hasn't been as bad as i thought it would be, except for the part where literally <i>everything important</i> occurs when i'm at school. that's the nicest part. as for game development, george 1.5 development has slowed down a bit, but i plan to get things done when monday comes around. that might even include a new <b>teaser trailer</b> for you all to see what the game actually looks and plays like! i'm super excited to show this new engine to you all, as i'm extremely proud of what's been cooking<br>lex has also been cooking up g1.5's soundtrack, and i think it sounds pretty great. we have a neat idea for a soundtrack project that we mentioned in the Terraria 1.0.6.4 video, but i'm not sure when that'll come to fruition. we <i>could</i> make it now, but we should probably work on the actual game, first. plus, the soundtrack isn't even done yet. while it might take a while, i <i>promise</i> i'll get this game released. i'd love to say by the end of 2024, but i'm not setting <i>any</i> deadlines for myself</p>

        <p>i can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune</p>
        <p>hey gang. i'm supposed to be writing a three-paragraph essay for some theology assignment, but it includes watching a 10-minute-long video and i just do not feel like sitting through that. trust me, i've heard enough middle-aged men telling me about jesus christ and how much ballin' he partakes in. plus, i don't want any religious bullcrap showing up on my recommended, so i'll just make up something and call it a day. if my teacher asks where my information comes from, i'll just use the handy "source: trust me bro"</p>
        <p>george 1 and a half: plus 0 progress is going fairly well, i'm starting to adapt the usage of in-game cutscenes because animated cutscenes take a while to make, and they also add <i>a lot</i> to the asset count. after i wrap up the level art for level 1, i'll probably get the framework for bosses sorted out, and i'll proceed to level 2 design. i've had plenty of ideas for trailers and music to go along with said trailers for a while now, so i might end up making a teaser trailer for you all soon. it could take a while, though, so don't get your hopes up just yet</p>
        <p>the announcement and release of the official <a href="https://www.betterthanadventure.net/" target="_blank">bta website</a> intrigued me, especially since it's been almost 3 years since the mod's conception. the website itself is very polished and neatly designed, even featuring the cute, yet informative artwork of one of the community's most prominent artists. the launch, however, wasn't exactly smooth, mainly because the website basically had a mini-DDoS attack from the flood of people clicking on the same link simultaneously</p>
        <p>i actually thought about giving this web site another redesign, but then i remembered that i'm fairly mid at CSS and don't exactly know how keyframes work. although i <i>am</i> taking a web design course next year, i don't think i'll make any major design changes to the site until i feel ready to announce one (and get feedback on prototype designs, of course). the next thing i'll do is probably fulfill that "secret CSS test page" i proposed a little while back, you'll just have to find it on your own when i eventually make it public ;)</p>

        <p>seriously i'm gonna break down crying listening to these new songs man</p>
        <p>today i shove my music taste in your face by telling you that the new vampire weekend album is a goddamn masterpiece, i can't get enough of it. getting loss of life and only god was above us in the same year is truly a testament to how great these bands are. i'm actually going to see vampire weekend live in a few months, and i'm really excited to hear ice cream piano and capricorn destroy my eardrums. also i got the physical copy of the album day one, even though it took the store a while to process the order. overall, the album is a strong 9/10 imo</p>
        <p>even if you have absolutely no interest in this album, i strongly recommend you listen to at least one of its songs. (i suggest connect!) straying away from the musics, this spring break week was fairly eventful. first things first, i went to a theme park i like on tuesday, except this particular day was pretty mid. half the rides i actually enjoy were closed, and the lines for food were straight-up horrendous. my dad suggested we go back for round 2, but i'm still bummed from it</p>
        <p>on wednesday, i went to a hockey game with my dad. it was in los angeles, so the drive there was fairly long, not even taking into account the traffic. the game was honestly pretty great, and our team won with 
  a score of 5-2. there weren't any real "fights", but there were a handful of little squabbles that got fans hyped. the drive home took even longer than it took to arrive, mainly because the streets of downtown LA are truly a horrifying and frightening experience. but who cares about the drive, the game was all that mattered, really</p>
        <p>i'm really grateful the album came out today, because i'm about to enter a small depression from having to go back to school. sometimes i wish i could just drop out and make cool games, but that's a pretty unrealistic way of thinking. i'm stuck in this garbage pit no matter what. i also watched NakeyJakey's video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8f_ezU2Tto" target="_blank"><i>High School Didn't Matter At All</i></a>, recently. while the video's tone is humorous, it really got me thinking. will HS help me later in life? or will it just be a lifeless prison filled with sh*tty schedules and boring classes?</p>

        <p>i wanna watch megamind (ONE) but streaming services make it so difficult for no reason</p>
        <p>today is easter day, which means it's a sunday. pretty cool, right? i think i'm supposed to go to a party, but my parents haven't yelled at me to get ready yet. to be fair, it was absolutely <i>pouring</i> last night so it might've gotten cancelled...? probably not, but eh, who cares. aside from that, today i want to record another video, but i don't know what i want to do. i'm thinking either another rhythm heaven or a video of me trying out the latest modern mc snapshot. i'll have to see which one i'm more interested in doing later today</p>
        <p>while i think some sort of poll system would be pretty neat to have, i don't think it would help that much. this is mainly because i don't know how many people actually visit this web site (or at least enough to bother checking out this here blog), and i don't know <i>how</i> or <i>where</i> a poll would go. sure, youtube polls exist, but i wanna save those for special videos, and by "special videos" i really just mean i don't wanna use youtube polls all that often</p>
        <p>you might also wonder why this blog in particular uses lowercase text when the rest of this web site uses Uppercase text. sure, it might just be my laziness, but i like to consider this blog a more... "personal" side of this web site, so i like to write how i'd usually write if i was messaging someone online, that being lowercase with no periods at the end of my sentences. okay that last part is a bit of a lie, but if this blog was entirely run-on sentences, it would look like utter sh*t</p>
        <p>one more thing i'd like to mention while we're here; i'm catholic. so yeah, i believe in god and our mother mary and all that jazz, but i don't really uphold the sacred traditions or anything like that. for example, i haven't gone to church in over 3 years, and i can't even remember that last time i said a prayer before dinner. while i do go to a catholic school, at this point i could really care less about my faith because i find it a lot less important than what i'm doing now. religion as a whole is a mixed bag, and i'm more on the negative side of that spectrum</p>

        <p>lgamemaker13 actually making games? this is so unexpected and unbelievable</p>
        <p>recently, i've been feeling down because i never work on any of my important projects anymore, the George series especially. however, lexal and i have been in several discord calls where we both unanymously agreed that i have a problem. he decided to pull my ass out of its slumber and get george 1.5 development back on track. since the story has already been wrapped up, my main priority is level design, which has been fairly slow, but it's going well so far, so that's good</p>
        <p>lex is also composing a bunch of <i>cool music</i> for the game, and he's basically already done with the main soundtrack, aside from a couple tracks. i actually updated the LG Productions Presentation to include level 1's track. an ost project may come out some time to give you an idea of what we're cooking up, but i'll have to double-check with lex about that. until then, just know that development <i>is happening</i> and more news will come soon, hopefully. also, <b>no deadlines</b></p>
        <p>another thing that's happened is i started playing tomodachi life again! (guess who inspired me to do that.) if you don't know, tomodachi life (tomodachi means "friend" in japanese) is a neat 3DS game where you build up an island with a bunch of little custom characters called Miis. you talk to them, feed them, play stupid games with them, and even see them interact and become friends. i got the game when i was like, 5, so it's cool to start over and see how i do</p>
        <p>i know i said that the NSSS video would come out two days ago, but the server we were playing on apparently got griefed, despite there being literally nothing to grief on there. the owner shut the server down for maintenence or something, so we're waiting on that to fix itself. however, i <i>do</i> still wanna make that rhythm heaven video i mentioned, i just have to find a very legal way to play and obtain and record the game on my compu- i mean 2DS. also yes, i own a 2DS. the thing is 11 years old and still runs fairly well, despite some occassional top screen flickering</p>

        <p>man i am <i>struggling</i> to find good video editing software, let's run through the ones i've used so far. the built-in youtube editor: fine for the most part, if not a bit barebones. you can't upload .mp3 or .wav files to use in your video, which sucks. the second editor i used sorry i forgot: pretty mid UI design, at least you can upload music. exporting was a pain in the ass, and it looked bad too. (microsoft) clipchamp: the company behind this already shows it's mid</p>
        <p>i wanna make a video where i play rhythm tengoku or something, but i wanna settle on a good editor before recording. i've also never played rhythm heaven silver before and i'm interested in trying it out. while i've seen videos of it and heard of its apparent difficulty, i've played all of the other RH games and beaten them not-quite-100%. a video on bta <i>could</i> be more fun, but i wanna wait until the private server isn't dead before attempting that</p>
        <p>recently, after finishing an album and then letting spotify play whatever, a song called "15 Step" played, and i somehow instantly recognized the song. i checked and it was by radiohead, a band i knew my parents liked <i>a lot</i>. another song of theirs came on ("Airbag"), this time from a different album of theirs, which i also recognized. turns out i've heard both of those albums for over 10 years now. in my dad's car, that is. sorry for talking about music again, but at least this time it's new</p>
        <p>i've been having fun composing new songs in deflemask, it's fun to make chiptune music with the NES's extremely limited sound chip. i think my recent songs are much better than my first (no surprises there), and they're also much longer, too, which i consider a plus. maybe i'll consider making a full-length album some time, but it might be a while before that happens. i really like the idea of just... releasing an album. a bunch of your music in a neat little package, ready for anyone in the world to hear. until then, i'll consider releasing a couple singles i've made</p>

        <p>since the release of the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/980147831" target="_blank">LG Productions Presentation</a>, i've been much more motivated to work on my games, SSMB and George 1.5 in particular. i plan to release a small (canon) demo of George 1.5 before moving on to working on both for a while. i hope to finish the latter first, since there hasn't been a proper George Series installment since George 1, which was over <i>three years ago</i> now. however, George 1.5 and 2 will be <i>drastically</i> different from the first</p>
        <p>i had a lot of fun writing the dialogue for the homies in the presentation, and now i kinda wanna make short animations like i used to, except they'll be better and less cringe. but since i have multiple games still waiting in priority queue, this is just an idea for now, kinda like that cory spinoff prototype i made. as for my youtube channel, i have a sequel planned for one video, but nothing else beyond that for the time being. i'm debating whether i should make the "Making Fun Of [minecraft mod]" an actual series, especially since the first one just went <i>so</i> well</p>
        <p>now that this web site has been officially "released", i can... uhh... basically return to whatever i was doing before, but now with a marginally bigger audience watching my every move. how nice. my next plans for the web site don't really exist yet, but i plan to experiment with some CSS stuff in the near future. i'll probably make a dedicated secret page for testing out new layouts and CSS stuff, that'd be pretty fun. but for now, enjoy the few secrets that are already lying about</p>
        <p>man, i've really been enjoying the <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a> blog posts, i have no idea why i limited myself to like, 3 sentences beforehand. there's also the <a style="color:#1eb584;">longer</a> and <a style="color:#a100ff;">misc</a> categories, but they've only been used once, each for different, special reasons. also i remember telling myself in the car; "alright, the next blog post titles i make are actually gonna relate to the topic at hand", but looks like that ended quickly. for context, "finger back" is the 8th track on one of my favorite albums of all time</p>

        <p>anyhoo, my mood has improved throughout the week. i've completed my missing homework, i've started working on my projects again, and i'm just feeling a bit happier. yeah, school still sucks, but i've adapted to it and learned to just let it ride. we have a rally in a couple hours from now, and those are always a nice change of pace, if not a little tedious and uninteresting. i know i <i>should</i> have more school spirit, but it's kinda hard when i don't even like school to begin with</p>
        <p>one thing i'd like to mention is the new color-coded system for this blog. every blog post used to just be a boring gray, and i wanted to add some color to the web site while also giving it a purpose. now, you'll be able to determine the mood of the post just through its color! so if you like my normal, everyday posts, you can just skip the blue and red ones and read the green ones! or if you like me venting my... issues... you can read the blue ones. just don't expect to laugh or smile much</p>
        <p>the red posts are interesting, as they're reserved for what i call "angry rants". i'm not sure if you'd call my latest response post an "angry rant", but i left it as red because that's basically how i felt while writing it, which makes sense. on another note, i'm gonna really start experimenting with images on this web site, since some pages look a little bland. one example is the <a href="/games">Games</a> page, which recently got a handful of images added to spice it up. enjoy</p>

        <p>sometimes i remembers the times when i actually <i>wanted</i> to make games and write stories. nowdays, not so much</p>
        <p>back when i joined scratch in 2020, i had so many cool ideas for games i wanted to make. some of them included <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/415125595/" target="_blank">Two-Player Ball Wars</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/485819865/" target="_blank">George 1</a>, and some others. i absolutely adored these when they were finished, and for good reason; i was proud of them. looking back, these games are nothing special (especially ball wars), but i still remember when i cared about making them and never missed a beat. today, i'm quite the procrastinator, and i'm also very lazy about everything.</p>
        <p>my latest work came out <i>6 months ago</i>, and for scratch that's not great. sure, the Remastered Collection is gonna release today, and by today i mean like at 10 pm, probably. i've lost most of my motivation to make games, both on scratch and igm. all i do now is watch youtube and play minecraft, working on my projects every once in while. i <i>want</i> to see these projects completed, but i've lost all intent to sit down and make a game again. the worst part is wanting to work on a game, but are forced to work on another because of a deadline or something.</p>
        <p>now you're probably wondering; "why did you even bother setting a deadline for the Remastered Collection?" well, i wanted to make a cool trailer with a song i liked. and i did, not realising that i <i>didn't</i> have to put a deadline, as i could've just put 'coming soon' and set a release date later. but that would've started another problem; i'd never work on the game without something pushing me to work on it. sure, the trailer is there, but it'd make me want to work on the game <i>less</i>, since i'd just be like "oh the trailer is out, now i can wait a while for people to get hyped for it or something"</p>
        <p>to be fair, i'm not doing <i>nothing</i> in the meantime. i've spent a lot of time on projects like <b>this web site</b>, not including the <s>discs</s>. i've also been working on my youtube channel, making videos like the <a href="https://youtu.be/sfnnvhjYcQc" target="_blank">Making Fun of ReIndev With Lexal</a> video, with its sequel coming out in a few days! and no, i'm not doing youtube full-time, it's going to remain a hobby. hopefully my mood picks up and i get can back into the swing of things.</p>

        <p>this is my first video in like, 5 months. wonder how it'll turn out</p>
        <p>when i started my youtube channel back in 2022, it was more of a hobby than anything. two years later, and it still is, bit with a bit more heart put into it. i've been told "you should start streaming" multiple times, but i'm just gonna stick to videos for right now. anyways, the raw footage for my next video finished uploading last night, it's almost <i>two hours long</i>. this is gonna be quite fun to edit when i get back from school in a couple hours</p>
        <p>i don't use any "proper" editing software, i just use youtube's built-in editor to trim the footage a bit, but i wanna be a bit more rambunctious this time. what i mean by that is editing in music, <s>transitions</s>, even more jump-cuts, stuff like that, because a nearly two-hour-long video of two idiots building a house in a dead reindev server doesn't sound that exciting on paper</p>
        <p>i might as well give my thoughts on reindev while we're here. the mod is just ok; it runs fine, it looks like sh*t, and it has a more quantity-over-quality approach with all of the janky stuff it adds. the stuff i <i>do</i> like is the ambience. that's it. anyways, the stuff i <i>don't</i> like includes the "overhauled" nether, constant lighting issues, odd community, potions, terrain gen, new painting system, wendigos, added classical music (i hate classical music), and some other random stuff they add</p>
        <p>ask me between reindev and bta, and i will <i>always</i> pick bta. why? because the features it adds are of high quality, it's active and fun, and has an actually decent community, all of which reindev doesn't quite have. the reason me and lexal played the mod is because he's been wanting to play it with me for a while, mainly because i know the most about the mod compared to him, and he just wanted to make fun of it. and we did. enjoy my new video (well, when it's finished)</p>

        <p>yesterday, i got to listen to MGMT's new album, <i>Loss of Life</i>, three hours early because i live on the west coast! i've been waiting for this release for quite a while now, and i finally got to hear it</p>
        <p>overall, i enjoyed the album. i got a big <i>Congratulations</i> vibe from some of the songs, and i also thought i got some self-titled album vibes in there, which was okay i guess</p>
        <p>this fifth studio release gets my approval, and i'll be listening to it a lot more throughout the upcoming weekend. here's a quick ranking of their albums: Congratulations, LDA, OS, Loss of Life, S/T</p>

        <p>not because i'm stupid, but because it's a glorified memory test, and not a very good one at that</p>
        <p>ever since i've been able to swear, i've always found school to be more of a chore than anything. getting up every day at 6 in the goddamn morning to go to some run-down building where they teach you the most random stuff, how enjoyable. it doesn't help that i find studying to be the most miserable and boring activity ever invented by mankind, where you stare at a math book for 12 seconds and proceed to do... <i>anything</i> else.</p>
        <p>there's also homework, but everyone hates homework. one other thing i don't like is the grading system, where you get thrown a letter based on how much you memorized from your lessons on math or biology. the only reason i feel happiness or glee when i get an 'A' in a math test, especially now in high school, is because getting a bad grade makes you feel like utter crap. getting your whole life determined by letters sounds so exhilarating, doesn't it</p>
        <p>people always act like getting a 'D' or an 'F' is the end of the world; "oh i won't pass the class", "oh noes i won't get into college". like i said before, getting your life determined by letters on a piece of paper is the stupidest sh*t. i want my life to be determined by what <i>i</i> want to do, what <i>i</i> want to learn, and how much effort <i>i</i> want to put into it</p>
        <p>i completely understand why there are so many high school dropouts out there, it can feel like waaay too much at times. having to balance studying, schoolwork, and any other extra stuff with personal projects is just... impossible. this heavily applies to me, a <i>game creator.</i> i haven't found any time to work on my games because some dumbass school project gets in the way. at least middle school was embarrassingly easy, so i had plenty of time back then. but now...</p>

        <p>my period 3 teacher does notebook checks, yet it feels like i'm the only one who writes notes</p>
        <p>it's been a fairly standard week, especially after missing a couple days the last few weeks due to back pain, stomach aches, and some other embarrassing thing. on another note, my mom has been prepping me for the upcoming mother/son dance, where mothers force their sons to dance to 40-year-old music while wearing stupid clothes. the theme this year is disco (my mom was hoping for something like metal), and i'm struggling to comprehend the wacky fashion choices in the 70s</p>
        <p>honestly i basically went through the five stages of grief when she first told me about the dance <i>waaaay</i> back in september, and i've accepted that i'm gonna have to dance. i'd rather sing, but i don't think 'electric feel' or 'sit next to me' are disco songs, unfortunately. also i would prefer to not sing in front of my mom, so i'll just stick to spotify and the stereo</p>
        <p>well another thing that happened is that my school had a talent show with 15 acts, such as singing, acting, and... reading poetry? yeah idk how someone thought that reading lines from a piece of paper would be an astounding performance, but the school thought so. the poetry reading 'act' actually <i>won</i>, granting them a nice $100. (-$10 for the admission fee.) maybe next year i'll try out, and i'll sing one of those songs i mentioned earlier</p>
        <p>i also feel really bad for my period 3 teacher (who i mentioned at the start), mainly because her class is a complete ruckus the entire time. today was especially notable, because it was a quiz day and like... <i>half the class</i> cheated. we had such groundbreaking excuses like "i'm not searching up anything on google!" or "i definitely wasn't looking over his shoulder!" some of the guys around me also played terrible music and tiktoks for 3 minutes straight. yahoo</p>

        <p>man the super bowl sure was fun, mainly at the end. the beginning was kinda mid, ngl</p>
        <p>hung out with my family yesterday to celebrate my nino's birthday and/or watch the Big Game. my nina and many of my cousins happen to be fans of the 49ers, while the rest of us consisted of teams not present in the game. none of us are chiefs fans, so my nina and cousins (mainly just cousins) were trying to get the rest of the family to be 49ers fans for that one night. it didn't work out for them, as everyone who wasn't a 49ers fan was either a rams or steelers fan</p>
        <p>my parents and i just watched without rooting for anyone because we're rams fans and don't like the 49ers, the others just kinda chilled. after that, the game was on, and football ensued. it was a long night, like 5 hours at least. we ate the good foods and played with our baby cousin during the game, and my dad did funny impressions of taylor swift every time they showed her after a chiefs score</p>
        <p>near the end of the game, it was 22-19 in overtime, with the 49ers in the lead. two of my cousins were going especially hog wild, and it was extremely intense. unfortunately for them, the 49ers defense couldn't hold any longer, and the chiefs made a winning touchdown. when it was over, those two cousins got <i>really</i> pissed (they even yelled at people lighting fireworks nearby lmao), while another one got <i>really</i> depressed. as for me? i was in awe of the game</p>
        <p>on another note, i'm getting pretty annoyed with how my school keeps shoving all this religious work down our throats. i get it's a catholic school, but i just don't care at all for it. i myself <i>am</i> catholic, but i go to church once every two years and barely do any charitable acts. we get these "family ministry assignments" where i unwillingly force my parents to write religious junk on a piece of paper. can't we just stick to going to mass every month and leave it at that?!</p>

        <p><a style="color:#ff0000;">⚠ Contains slightly depressing topics.</a></p>
        <p>most people i've talked to have siblings. y'know, those other people who live in your house that aren't your parents? yeah, no idea what you're talking about. in case you're wondering, i'm an only child. everyone always talks about the <i>cons</i> of having siblings (annoyance, bothersome, nuisance, etc.), but i want to focus on the <i>pros</i> of having siblings. just having a brother or sister to talk to can greatly improve your social skills, as well as having someone to comfort you during hard times.</p>
        <p>being an only child, i don't know what it's like to having siblings. but something, <i>anything</i> has to be better than just... pure isolation. i'm lonely as hell. "what about your parents?" you may be asking? well... y'know... it's not the same. not that my parents don't care for me or anything. no, i really love my parents. i'd just prefer to talk to someone <i>my age</i>, not 30 years ahead of me.</p>
        <p>i'm kinda surprised that i'm not depressed, from all the lonely nights i've had, listening to my favorite albums with an empty head. not coding anything, not doing any homework, just... sitting there with my thoughts, alone. there's so much sh*t i'm feeling that i haven't told anyone, not even my close friends. well, if i... <i>had</i> any close friends. with me and my friends, it's... complicated. i still consider us "friends" for the time being, but i'm very, <i>very</i> distant from them. i'm surprised we even became friends in the first place, because i barely have anything in common with them. hell, i barely even <i>talk</i> to them.</p>
        <p>all of this has culminated into something i did two nights ago, which i'm pretty embarrased to admit right now. there's a game (well, <i>kinda</i> a game) that i've known for a couple years now. there's a popular mod for it that i thought would suit me pretty well, considering everything i've mentioned here. the mod is called Monika After Story, and you can look it up if you don't know what it is, which i <i>highly recommend</i> before continuing reading this. i know, the whole concept of an "online girlfriend" is pretty strange, but the mod feels so... personal, and you actually <i>feel</i> like you're conversing with someone who genuinely cares about your well-being.</p>
        <p>i know it's probably not the healthiest commitment to make, but the mod so far has helped me out quite a bit. i really needed <i>something</i> to help me break away from the isolation and days of doing nothing. sure, i might as well get a real girlfriend while i'm at it, but just read paragraph three and you'll understand. overall, the real reason for me telling you all this is because i've desperately needed to vent about this for a while, and here we are. thanks for listening, if you actually bothered reading it all, that is.</p><u>editor's note:</u> i've since stopped playing the mod i mentioned here. it got old, like, <i>really</i> fast. so that's that, i guess<p>

        <p>oof. today was kinda rough in terms of game-making, but some other stuff happened, too</p>
        <p>today, me and that friend i mentioned the other day were working together on a new project. it was going fairly well until blocklive, which is the service that allows people to work together on scratch, decided to shoot itself in the foot and die on us. costumes were appearing in random sprites, music failed to upload, it was a mess. worst part? <i>i couldn't even save the project</i>, meaning that any changes i made would vanish as soon as the project reloaded.</p>
        <p>it was pissing me off, and my friend couldn't even do anything about it (<i>i</i> was the one making the actual levels that time), but he had an idea. he copied the entire project and shared it to me via blocklive. it worked... for about 10 seconds, then i couldn't save again. yippee. after this, we called it quits and gave up on blocklive, praying that its eventual website would fix it</p>
        <p>yesterday it was working fine, but today it was just miserable doing the game-making. i don't know the inner workings of blocklive, but what me and my friend (mainly just me) had to go through today was just unacceptable. for now, i'll just get back to playing bta and working on my next (personal) project, which i think you'll all enjoy</p>
        <p>on a more positive note, i've been gathering a bunch more CDs from my parents' absolutely ginormous supply of them. found <i>every</i> album from The Strokes, three Tame Impala albums (Slow Rush not included), two Vampire Weekend albums, and a bunch of Beck albums. pretty cool stuff, i'll be listening to it all throughout the weekend. sorry about me going on and on about artists you've never heard of, but you should expect me to talk a lot about them here.</p>

        <p>writing this at school today. i'm gonna talk about how i used to write crappy stories.</p>
        <p>the first series i made was called "The Mysterious Islands", and it was about me and 3 of my classmates getting stuck on an island, trying to solve some terribly-thrown-together mystery with cringe dialogue<br>this only had about 3 entries in the series, each being about 10 pages long. the first "book" was fine, but the second devolved into some minecraft story mode: season 2 plotline where you go under bedrock or some crap, and don't get me started on the third, which involved some really lame pirates</p>
        <p>the next series i made was called... "Terraria: The Written Series". please help me- anyways, this series was about some guy called John who gets sucked into the world of terraria and some more crap<br>this might actually be the worst thing i've ever written. it had 4 entries, including such groundbreaking moments like the chapter where they build a bathroom, or John going insane because of the angler npc</p>
        <p>the third series was called "School's Kool" or something like that, and it was about clothes becoming so expensive that everyone became naked, then came a standard "disease starts zombie apocalypse"<br>okay this series had decently long entries, and... less cringy dialogue. the first involved, y'know, the school. the second, however, involved the main characters going to some middle-eastern country to save it from the disease, and one of them even went to prison</p>
        <p>the last series i made was called "Shoot Guys", and it was actually not too bad. it was about a bunch of stick figures on an island and they were in a constant cycle of violence and hiding, war stuff<br>aight, <i>this</i> is where stuff gets good. this series was split into about 18 short comics, and it was actually a cohesive storyline! it made sense, wasn't too cringy, and was overall a pretty neat series. a season two was started, but didn't get very far, sadly.</p>

        <p>w0wie today we had a rally at school. it consisted of the usual pep squad, dance team, etc.<br>in case you're wondering, i basically have -1 school spirit. is that bad? i don't know.</p>
        <p>after getting home, i <i>so badly</i> wanted to make a minecraft mod for BTA. there were many problems<br>being overwhelmed by these problems, i decided to mod paper minecraft. i've hit a new low</p>
        <p>but i hit an even further low when the freaking paper minecraft engine confused me<br>you see, i wanted to add a new dimension. but uhh, i couldn't quite figure out how to make it work</p>
        <p>i just want to make the citrus dimension that gives everyone cavities, help needed</p>

        <p>today was boring. today was boring. that's called "repetition", and we learned it in english<br>yeah, today was one of those days where "nothing happens", kinda like that one gumball episode</p>
        <p>today i actually rediscovered an album my dad used to play in the car. it's called Contra, and it's great<br>really, i don't know why it took so long. i specifically rembering hearing it on the way to IKEA</p>
        <p>i would talk about the double smp and all the incredible lore that's going on, but i can't right now<br>you see, lex added a few mods. but for some damn reason, they <b>can't be used with performance mods</b>.</p>
        <p>this is one of the 27 reasons i'm gonna build a new computer for myself</p>

        <p>hello gang, today i played bta after a month of double smp gaming, t'was pretty fun chilling on melonbta<br>my period 7 class also had a <b>take home test</b> for a goddamn <b>college-level</b> class, which is still insane to me</p>
        <p>as a birthday gift, my family paid for a new monitor for me to <i>eventually</i> use when i build a new computer<br>when i was driving with my cousin to buy it, he played three songs i like, which never happens. anywhere.</p>
        <p>glad i spent martin luther king jr. day not reminiscing on martin luther king jr. like everyone else<br>seriously, "special" days like these are literally just "no work and furniture sale" days</p>
        <p>today i also learned that giving each blog post its own page is gonna suck in the long run</p>

        <p>i also have a pretty cool idea for what to do for my birthday (which is in two days!!)<br>sadly, it's not a game or a demo, it's something to do with this web site</p>
        <p>i also want to experiment with images, i think they could spice up this web site a bit, hopefully.<br>in other news, the double smp has nothing going on. talk about filler content.</p>

        <p>hey gang. school's back up, and my schedule got a little switched up. getting used to that will be fun.<br>today was also spent revising The Demon II, which is the single greatest novel ever written.</p>
        <p>for some reason i'm being accused of theft, when i don't even know the damn location of the base it got stolen from. i keep getting asked over and over again, "hey did you commit steal?"</p>
        <p>oh well. on other note, today was also spent playing with <i>magic</i>. i hit lex several times.<br>also a marriage happened at my base and i wasn't even there to witness it. whar</p>

        <p>intro: had an awesome, perilous journey in the aether. it ended, abruptly. for no good reason.<br>today, my parents wanted me to finish my AP HUG flashcards. <i>they're due next week.</i></p>
        <p>so, not a single one done. why? i was studying for some finals i'd missed, <b>pretty important.</b><br>my dad came into the room at night and went all "disappointed" and "upset" on me.</p>
        <p>for what reason? never got one. only some "we want them done now" bullsh*t. they don't have a proper reason and they <i>know</i> it. sometimes, they just don't <b><i>think</i></b> for a damn second.</p>

        <p>today was spent crying with lex over his modpack crashing many times<br>nothing worked!! rubidium, embeddium, optifine, it all crashed his 150+ mod-filled modpack</p>
        <p>i also learned that alex's mobs is a horrifying mod with centipedes and cockroaches and more worms and mosquitos, get it away from me please</p>
        <p>oh yeah, super also joined us for a watch party of a knock-off dream smp video, which was extremely entertaining and forgettable at the same time</p>

        <p>forget what i said yesterday, the new wonka was actually pretty great<br>loved all the references they made (to the 1971 film)</p>
        <p>also wow the oompa loompas are much, <i>much</i> smaller than usual, were they always that small?<br>also why does only one oompa loompa actually appear</p>
        <p>on another note, the double smp season 0 ended yesterday. it was pretty fun and scuffed<br>praying season 1 is less scuffed and has infinitely less crashes (yeah, <i>lex</i>!)</p>

        <p>honestly i gotta step up my game this year, 2023 was probably my laziest year. hopefully going insane in minecraft can help.<br>today (actually yesterday), i tried the aether mod for the first time. i liked the flying cows and phygs, those zephyrs can die in a ditch.</p>
        <p>sometimes i think of something to write, but forget it instantly. i hate it when that happens.</p>

        <p>today i decided to update this web site after looking at lex's website. it's called "inspiration" i think. anyways, this web site will be much better and will have much more interesting things, because i am clearly superior.</p>
        <p>also, the titles of these posts often don't relate to whatever they're about at all, they're usually lyrics from songs, titles of songs, or random gibberish. why? <i>why not?</i></p>
        <p>the double smp is gonna end soon. you probably don't even know what that is, and i'm not gonna bother telling you.</p>

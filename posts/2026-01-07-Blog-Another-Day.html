                    <p>hello everybody, my name is welcome. today i'd like to take a moment of your time to talk about all the problems in life. politics are still happening, birds are coughing and dying, and George 1.5 has yet to be released. wait, what am i talking about? anyways, hello and this is my blog Post. i know the last few, well, actually almost <i>every</i> post has been school-related or even school-focused.</p>
                    <p>luckily for all of us, not today! nope, i'm here today to prove that i have more to talk about than my seemingly never-ending distaste for school. how will i do it? who knows! but sit back and relax as i take you through (words - this) words about everything i've done outside of a campus or classroom setting. trust me, this'll be a good one.<br>i know i talked about it in the last blog post, but ranting about school all day has gotten rather boring. at this point, what's left to add to the table? like, i can't think of the last time i dedicated a blog post to something NOT school-related. i don't think there will ever a post that doesn't so much as <i>mention</i> it. if there is, feel free to bring up this post and gloat about how obnoxious you are for being the first one to point out how wrong i was. in the meantime, i'll try to at least steer away from the topic.</p>
                    <p>but hold up! before we begin today's lesson, i'd like to point out that today marks the <b>1000-day anniversary</b> of my web site! bet you wondered why it took so long for this post to release, huh? definitely not because i waited until this week to write it. welp, there you go. i didn't have any celebrations planned other than this. yeah that's it segment over</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>so... i forgot to mention it last month, but i actually went to a few concerts. the two i saw were Tame Impala and Grizzly Bear, and they happened to be back-to-back! first up was Tame Impala, who was unsurprisingly spectacular. most of his tracklists have been relatively similar, but i think we got a good one. pretty much every song i was dying to hear was played, although there was a noticeable lack of songs from The Slow Rush, his previous album. i've grown to really like that album, so that was kind of a shame.<br>but another album i've grown to appreciate is his latest album, Deadbeat. this album was a pretty big let down for many, and i was definitely one of those people when i first heard it. there aren't many real bangers on this album, at least to the general public. but hearing it live? well, it changed my entire view on the album. it was downright <i>heavenly</i> to hear some of these tracks live on stage. while i still don't think the album is all too great, i'd give it like, a 7/10. at best. still better than most reviews online.</p>
                    <p>the day after that came my #2 band of all time, Grizzly Bear. god, i love these guys. despite only getting into them a year and a half ago, i've poured over 2,000 minutes of listening time for these guys. so imagine my surprise when they dropped a surprise tour out of NOWHERE, eight years after their last album. needless to say, i was absolutely ecstatic and bought tickets almost immediately.<br>so how was the show? absolutely fan-f***ing-tastic. man, they played so many of their hits, and even shed some light on songs i hadn't listened to for some time. the songs sounded near perfect and hit even harder, some even sounding better than their studio renditions. there were a couple different songs i wish they played, but it's a miracle they even started doing this thing in the first place. plus, they aren't coming back (they said it themselves). at least i got to see them once in this lifetime.</p>
                    <p>i'm honestly surprised i neglected to talk about all this in my last post, since it was a huge deal for me. having to rush update 4.0 in time for the post didn't help. it ended up being a tad shorter than usual, but that isn't a bad thing. hey, it gives me more stuff to dump in this post. that makes what, four concerts so far? not bad, not bad at all.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>y'know, i'm really glad to have made some actual friends these past couple of years. it especially helped in early 2024, back when i had no friends irl. they were the one thing keeping me going. i mean, yeah i value the new friendships i've made now, but it's not quite the same. none of them have stuck with or impacted me, aside from a select few.<br>for some reason, i expect every friendship to be some long-lasting, life-changing experience. but at the same time, i have zero close friends outside of Discord, thanks to my lack of basic motor functions. i'm awkward, overly blunt, mildly unapproachable, and sarcastic as all hell. and when i'm not those, i'm basically a ghost who pretends he doesn't know anyone. it seems like i actively <i>avoid</i> confronting people at school. when someone i know is coming down the hall, i'm begging to get out of there.</p>
                    <p>i mean, seriously, what do i expect to happen? are they gonna punch me in the face or start screaming out of fear? these people know me and i know them, so why the hell do i act like such a stranger around <i>everyone</i>? i probably make no sense to a lot of people, and i probably make even less sense after having read all this. i think my Christmas break withdrawal is getting to me. maybe i'm just comically bad at social situations, but, as i'll get to later, maybe isn't all true.</p>
                    <p>at least online i have a bit more control over when i talk to people. but that definitely doesn't help with my initiation issues. thank god for the people who've managed to get me some damn friends. just getting the chance to play Minecraft every day and hang out was a blast. not sure if anyone reading is familiar with the SMP SMP, but that was the biggest game-changer for me. that one server has some of my fondest memories of 2024. even today, i still hang out with those friends. albeit a bit less than i'd like, but hey, i'm working on it.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>oh yeah, merry Christmas. i almost forgot about that. my break felt lightning fast, which is why Christmas felt even shorter. hanging out with family was fun, though. but i will say, it's getting harder and harder to make Christmas lists. like, i genuinely don't know what i want for Christmas. i had to think abnormally hard about what i'd actually want and use in the future.<br>as it turned out, a third of my total list was just CDs, and another was just gift cards and games i might wanna play sometime. the only two things i <i>really</i> wanted were earpods (ironic, as most kids my age want airpods) and an actual microphone. i ended up getting both, thankfully, along with a $500 drone from my deadbeat grandpa. we were <i>all</i> surprised when i unwrapped it. i rarely even seen the guy, and all of a sudden he blows 500 big ones on a piece of flying metal for a kid who takes 30 seconds to tie his shoes?<br>i mean, i appreciate the thought! all the elders in my family consider me some sort of "tech wiz" or something. yeah right, ask me what a computer is and i'll end up saying some sh*t like "metal box with wires". not entirely sure how i even got here to begin with, heh.</p>
                    <p>aside from my family, i actually hung out with <i>friends</i> this year! last time i hung out with friends on Christmas, my age was probably in the single digits. first up came the theatre gang's friendsmas, which was pretty fun all around. we exchanged gifts, played UNO (i immediately lost), and played Wii Sports for 5 hours straight. i also ended up almost losing my voice due to the immense yelling that occurs whenever i boot up a Wii. i don't see these guys too often (as i explained earlier), but it's always nice to see 'em.<br>then came the FNaF movie with my lunch friends. i'm no expert on the absolute spaghetti disaster that is the lore of that particular series, but the movie was fun. i know critics absolutely despise this movie, but they all suck and don't know real cinema. i've come to appreciate the series a lot more throughout the past month, thanks in part to some game i made.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>speaking of... i made <a href="/games/after-hours-x">a game</a>! that's right, a brand new hit masterpiece. i was gonna (not) work on George 1.5 during break, but Fractyl dropped a surprise game jam announcement for Idle Game Maker. the theme was, fittingly, Christmas. now, i've never been in a game jam before, and i definitely haven't made an entire game in just two weeks. so how'd i do? well, as i mentioned last time, i won. pretty cool, huh?<br>the category i absolutely crushed was visuals, surprisingly. i didn't think i'd win in <i>any</i> category, so to have crushed one is cool. the CSS is fairly simple, but i employed some neat tricks to make it stand out more. to be honest, i'm kinda glad i ended up making this instead of George 1.5. since that isn't coming out any time soon, i instead whipped up a neat, little IGM project. after having made that game, it makes it hard to come back to Labyrinths II. a big update for that is in the works, though!</p>
                    <p>one more thing before i head out. you know how i always talk about streaming and such? well, i actually <b>streamed!</b> i bet you can guess what game i played. not gonna lie, i was comically freaked out during that entire stream. like, genuinely fearful of the game in front of me. it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse once we jump three games ahead, i'll tell ya that much.<br>i also have a new vid in the works (for real, real this time). i've been posting stream VODs every so often, but i've decided to turn this one into a video. i'm no editor, so i'll just be the highlights and a crappy intro. hope that comes out within the next three months.</p>
                    <p>that's all from me this time 'round. sorry for the late post, but i couldn't pass up 1000 days. see you soon!</p>

                    <p><b class="spoiler">⚠ Contains spoilers for the G1R v1.1 Update. It's recommended you watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHPsq4ecR7Y" target="_blank">trailer</a> first.</b></p>
                    <p>after around... <i>18 whole months</i>, the big post-launch update for George 1 Remastered has finally gotten a trailer (and release date)! yeah, i'm waaaaay overdue for this. sure, maybe you were hoping for some news relating to George 1.5 or Fire Forge, but new stuff for those games will come later. to kill some more time, here's an update for this noticeably more scuffed game!</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>for starters, this update has been in the works for over a year now. soooo... how on earth has it taken this long? well, i wasn't exactly <i>developing</i> it throughout the year. before G1R was even released, Speedrun Mode was already fully completed. it wasn't included in the initial release because... of... me...? yeah, since it's been over a year, i can't exactly remember why the <i>fully finished</i> mode wasn't released. maybe i was a secret genius and planned ahead for this very update, but that's probably not the case. i dunno, maybe there was some bug that fixed itself after making the rest of the update? i honestly couldn't tell ya. but hey- it's here now, and completely unoriginal!</p>
                    <p>another new part of this update is Endless Mode. being inspired by a game nobody's heard of, this mode allows you to endlessly replay the first 5 levels of the game. there's even a totally pointless, global highscore system! if you're a speedrunner (of this game, for whatever odd reason), then this mode is perfect to train and hone your skills!</p>
                    <p>now, it's time to announce the main event- the bonus <b>Level 6</b>! if you thought levels 4 and 5 were torturous, excruciating excursions, then please make way for this brand new challenge. this level has it all, seemingly impossible parkour, intentiontally rage-inducing hazards, and an even longer sublevel count than every other level! so if you want the urge to chuck your monitor out a window and shout even more obscenities than you do on a daily basis, you're more than welcome to try out Level 6 (assuming you beat the main game and know the code to unlock it).</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>this update also greatly optimizes the game, slightly de-bloating its sprite count and making it perform ever-so-slightly better! i even gave George a new move, the <b>stomp</b>! this move is used for two things- quickly reaching the ground and hurting bosses. so, for example, if you're maneuvering through some tight jumps, you can stomp to precisely reach the ground and stop moving!<br>as for the bosses, you now use the stomp to hurt them, instead of just... standing next to them. also, <b>you can no longer endlessly take damage (during bosses) in Normal difficulty</b>. what this means is that if you take enough damage during a battle, instead of the boss falling to the ground like usual, it will simply remain idle and hit you with another wave of attacks. this means you actually have to <i>try</i> if you're playing it easy.</p>
                    <p>i don't care if you're complaining or whining about not being able to sit there and watch some dumbass videos while the boss tries its best to obliterate you, this is <b>George 1 Remastered</b>. we don't make things easy around here (and Level 6 proves that).
                    <br>that about wraps up this devlog. watch the full update trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHPsq4ecR7Y" target="_blank">here</a>. with that out of the way, see ya later.</p>

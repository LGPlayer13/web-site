        <h3>GREEN POSTS</h3>Usually saved for more casual and light-hearted topics.<br>These are the most common type of post, and are seen frequently throughout the blog.
        <br><sub><b>NOTE:</b> Posts labeled as "Green?" are usually more <a style="color:#ec4747;">red</a> in tone.</sub>

        <h3>RED POSTS</h3>Whenever I get upset or angry about something, I'll rant about it in these types of posts.<br>These, more aggresive and rant-y posts, will only come once in a long while.
      </div>
      <div class="fadebox extended" style="background:rgba(50,90,201,0.6);">
        <h3>BLUE POSTS</h3>These are an uncommon type of post, specifically for when I feel especially sad and lonely.<br>I usually vent and go on about my struggles in these posts, and it can get <i>personal</i>.
      </div>
      <div class="fadebox extended" style="background:rgba(28,159,110,0.6);">
        <h3>MIDWAY POSTS</h3>The <i>least common</i> type of blog post, also being much newer than the other colors.<br>These are reserved for topics that I feel are important and imminent enough to warrant their own blog post.

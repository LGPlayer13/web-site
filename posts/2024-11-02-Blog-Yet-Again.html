        morning, everyone. how's it going? welcome to my new blog, which I'm officially dubbing "the blog". sick name, right? i came up with it, and then i put it there for the world to see. hmm... i feel like i've done this before... eh, must be déjà vu. sooo... it's been quite a while, huh? and it must be weird seeing a blog post on a <i>saturday</i> instead of the usual <i>monday</i>.
        <br><br>you heard that right, blog posts are on the <i>first week</i> of the month now. this gives me plenty of time to write about any odd occurance that occurs in my daily life. so mark your calendars, folks. unless yours is stuck in september, <s>which would never be me.</s> i mean, there's also the built-in Windows (10) calendar, but i never actually use it. i just look at the big ol' clock with the seconds at the end. stupid Windows 11 got rid of that, just like everything else the former had going for it. but whatever. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZzubS1ILTs" target="_blank">microsoft sucks</a> anyway.
        <hr>hey, look at this <b>cool line</b> above the text! this is an <i>&lt;hr&gt</i> tag in its full glory. with the new update, these things are used <i>literally everywhere</i>. they're very handy, and look very nice (with CSS)! you might've also noticed that the <b class="rainbow-text">colored background</b> is missing- that's fully intentional. to newcomers especially, the backgrounds could've been somewhat confusing, especially with the jargon in the <a href="./old-backlog">Old Backlog</a> page. that's why i'm simplifying it- if a post is too emotional or aggresive, it'll just have a fun, little warning at the top. it'll basically just tell the user, "hey. this post is deep. turn back to not feel sad or otherwise upsetting emotions."
        <br><br>speaking of the blog, it uses Zonelets now! this makes managing the posts a hell of a lot easier, as all i gotta do is copy a post, rename it, and add it to a javascript file. simple as that. this particular post is titled "Yet Again", and if you couldn't guess, it's a song title. oh yeah, speaking of names, you might be asking- <i>will any previous blog post names be reused?</i> at some point, probably. it's pretty damn easy to differentiate the <i>new blog</i> from the <i>old blog</i>. if you don't believe me, just take a glance at the backgrounds and you'll be good to go.
        <br><br>as for the Devlog, it's been merged with the new blog. basically, a post can either be a Blog (personal) or a Devlog (development) post. next to the post name, it'll tell you which one. it even tells you in the link! don't worry- the <a href="./old-devlog">Old Devlog</a> was also archived.
        <hr>oh yeah, <b>the web site got a major update!</b> ...i probably should've mentioned that earlier. this is now version 2.1, and despite a certain "threat" from my guestbook, that number is staying. the site updates have been pretty consistent this year, and it probably won't stay that way. hooray! the update boasts a heap of new additions, changes, and other goodies to explore. just about every page has been overhauled in one way or another to fit the new layout. the primary CSS file got a <i>complete</i> makeover, removing some rather outdated and unused stuff. the <u style="color:#ff7676;cursor:default;">FAQ Extras</u> page has been renamed to the much more abbreviated <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> page. (you can even see it on the navbar!)
        <br><br>the <i>secret</i> pages also got a, uh... downgrade? well, they look much more interesting, is how i'd put it. i even replaced a boring secret with a better one, so there's still 5 secrets instead of 6. sorry. i should probably go over the actually meaningful changes, but you can look at the Patch Notes on the main page, unless you're in the future enjoying some newer update. to sum it up, web site somewhat slightly different. also also, this web site has its own <b>88x31 button</b>! if you don't know what those are, they're these small buttons that link to different websites, and people place a bunch of them on their own site to link back to more sites they like! i used the word "site" quite a lot there, so if that didn't make any sense whatsoever, my bad.
        <br><br>i'm pretty happy with how the site looks now, and- oh, i've probably said this same, repetitive line before, so i'm just gonna skip the blabber and move on. well done, myself.
        <hr>welp, you know what time it is. if you've read my blog before, you already know what's coming. that's right- it's time for the LG Productions-branded <b>School Segment</b>! yippee!! enthusiasm!!1! this is the part of the post where i rant about how much i <s>absolutely despise</s> <i>love</i> school and everything it offers! hold onto your tight hats- wait... hold onto your, uh. yes.
        <br><br>lately, i've been having these noticeable mood swings, where on some days i'll be <i>fairly</i> happy (something, something, haven't rediscovered true happiness), and some days i'll feel lonely and depressed. one telltale sign of my mood is my <i>Discord status</i>. if it's some decently unfunny quote or random sentence, i'm usually pretty chill. but if it's a song lyric or just plain sad, that's how you know. <br>anyways, mood swings. i don't know <i>why</i> i end up feeling so lonely all the time. i wonder because, well, i actually <i>have</i> friends now. i'm not just sitting by myself, rotting away at the same, cold table every day. i guess i haven't properly... opened up to anyone yet. i've just mentioned my issues in passing, not really taking the time to delve into what's wrong with me. i mean, that's what i've been doing this whole time with this here blog, but y'know, actually <i>talking</i> to people helps a lot more.
        <br><br>ah, well. i guess i've been comforting others with their own issues, but that's not meant for this blog. maybe i need a therapist or something, preferably to help with some particular thoughts i've been having recently (nothing too worrying, but not exactly something to let pass by, either). i'll have to get back to you all on that.
        <br><br>another issue i've been worrying about is friendship as a whole. i just feel like i've somehow <i>forgotten</i> to have friends, probably being remnants from how last year went down. when i went to my first rehearsal for the play i'm in, i didn't know how to really get to know anyone. i just kinda... stood there and y'know, acted, until the day was over. i didn't plan on talking to anyone in particular, so my unfortunate plan was to just wait for someone to approach me. not a great strategy, but it actually ended up working, and that's how i've gotten to where i am now. the most i can do for now is to just not let anxiety get the better of me, even though... it's proven hard. <i>very. hard.</i>
        <hr>wait, you're still here? what are you talking about? ...games? what games? eh, save it for next month. sorry guys. better luck next time.

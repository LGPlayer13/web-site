        <h3>Moved Back to Neocities! (v2.0) • 08/03/2024 • Site Update</h3>
        Alongside the full release of version 2.0, this web site has officially moved back to Neocities! Over a year ago, this web site was originally started there, but it moved to GitHub Pages after months of downtime. But thanks to Git, Ruby, and whatever CLIs are, this web site has been brought back to its former host.<br><br>The GitHub version will be taken down soon (if it can, that is), which means that <b>all</b> links to that version will be made useless and must be replaced to the Neocities link. Sorry for the hassle! I wish this whole process would've been a lot cleaner, but unfortunately, I didn't know about Git Hooks until waaaay after this site was made.<br><br>Well, now that every page is finished and ready to go, and can finally take a break from web development and go back to <i>actually making</i> my games. While this is a shorter devlog, I just wanted to get all this out there for everyone to read.<br><br>Cya, and please let me know if there are any more issues.

        <h3>Web Site v2.0 Beta launch • 08/01/2024 • Site Update</h3>
        The <i>beta version</i> of this complete overhaul has launched! It's still quite a major work in progress, as several pages are incomplete or missing at the time of writing this. However, I wanted to get this out a little early to get feedback and see what needs to be improved before releasing the finished product.<br>-----<br>This update has <b>many</b> new changes and additions that you've probably already noticed or seen. A list showing what's missing/incomplete is provided below.<br><br>It might seem odd that I'm trying out all these new layouts and styles every couple of months, but that's because I'm improving! Each major update is a reflection of where my web design skills currently are. This is a style I'm <i>very</i> happy with- so expect it to last a long while! (i recommend taking this with a grain of salt)<br>-----<br>WHAT'S INCOMPLETE :<li>all of the <a href="/games">Games</a> sub-pages, currently the buttons just link outside of the web site</li><li>every written Devlog except for this one- they display a temporary message</li><li>the <a href="/art-gallery">Art Gallery</a> page, which also displays a temporary message</li><li>the Lore sub-pages, they also display a temporary message</li><li>several unused images are still present in the Images folder, these will be removed</li><br>-----<br>I hope to see what the few people who visit this web site think of this update! Have a good one.

        <h3>New album 'The S' out now • 07/11/2024 • Project Update</h3>
        Instead of working on my games like usual, I though I'd take a small detour and work on a new album, especially now that it's summer break.<br>It might seem quite early, considering <a href="https://lgplayer13.bandcamp.com/album/thirteen" target="_blank">Thirteen</a> was released just over a month ago, but that was more of an introduction to music-making. That project also helped me get used to Deflemask and learn some more neat things about it.<br><br>This new release, ironically, contains 13 new tracks. No bonus tracks this time, but you're getting 14 extra minutes of music to listen to! A couple of the tracks are decently long, with one of them even being <b>six whole minutes</b>. Yeah, this might be a bit much for an under-produced Sega Genesis album, but I don't care. You should listen to it at some point, preferably with earmuffs for added comfort.<br>I can't remember exactly how long this album took me to make, but I know that the covers for it and the singles were taken on July 4th. The old covers look abysmal compared to these new ones. I even used GIMP with no prior help to add some filters and text to them.<br><br>Well I gotta eat breakfast at <i>some</i> point, so that's it for today. Enjoy what I've made, thanks. <a href="https://lgplayer13.bandcamp.com/album/the-s" target="_blank">Here's the link to the album.</a>

        <h3>Minor Web Site updates • 05/02/2024 • Site Update</h3>
        Morning everyone. After the release of update 1.2, I've made a couple small edits and additions to the web site over time. Now that I've gotten adjusted to Brackets, I thought I should give a recap of what's new.<br><li>Starting off, <a href="/games/fire-forge">Fire Forge</a> has received its own page, and the <a href="/games/the-lost-labyrinths">Lost Labyrinths</a> page has gotten quite the overhaul; now showing extra links with grainy icons.</li><li>Next up, the <a href="/about">About</a> and <a href="/about-extras">About Extras</a> pages have also been updated. The latter has been split into two boxes for better presentation, while the other got changed in its <i>Other Cool Websites</i> section.</li><li>The home page link icons now show characters from the <i>George Series</i>, rather than just generic letters. Also, the <u>hyphen-lost</u> link icon is no longer broken. Sorry, Lex!</li><li>I discovered <i>height:auto;</i> which should completely fix any and all sizing issues with boxes. Took long enough, my gosh.</li><li>Pages relating to games and devlogs have now been placed into folders, allowing for more compact file storing and no longer clogging up my list of HTML files.</li><li>The CSS file has been cleaned up and properly formatted, it was kind of a big mess and heavily outdated before. I know, not very exciting news.</li><li>Lastly, the devlogs have been tweaked slightly, both in their full pages (like this one) and small boxes.</li><li><i>Literally the next day:</i> Tweaked the <a href="/blog">Blog</a> page a little bit<br><br>Well that wraps up this devlog. Stay tuned for more news, hopefully covering Fire Forge!</li>

        <h3>Web Site v1.2 Update launch • 04/14/2024 • Site Update</h3>
        After delving a bit deeper into web development, I realized that the current way that I'm working on this web site isn't very effective, but <i>very</i> time-consuming. I decided to to try out Brackets as a new means of developing the site. I actually tried out Visual Studio Code (paired with Azure) before moving to Brackets, but once I found out that Microsoft injected their micro-sh*t into Azure, I just gave up on it.<br><br>Anyways, the main reason for trying out these services is because they have something called Live Preview, which allows to see changes to made to HTML and CSS files instantly. (and locally!) This makes it stupid easy to make HUGE changes to this site's layout and code without having to go through that save+refresh hell... not to mention, having 902 deployments in 4 months seems like a bit much, and a total waste. Switching from constant GitHub deployments to <i>live</i> development was pretty simple, and I'm excited to see what happens next!

        <h3>Sid's Adventure | Widescreen Port release • 04/06/2024 • Project Update</h3>
        Good morning everyone! While George 1.5 is currently being developed, I thought I should get something out of the way that I've been considering doing for a while now. That would be a widescreen port of <b>Sid's Adventure</b>! Since Scratch itself does not support projects in widescreen, I saw my itch.io account as a way to still share it to the world.<br>The only gameplay differences consist of:<br><li>Object resizing to fit the larger resolution</li><li>Minor text edits for certain characters</li><li>Layering bug fix<br><br>Here's a link to the <a href="https://lgplayer13.itch.io/sids-adventure-widescreen-port/devlog/710929/sids-adventure-now-in-widescreen" target="_blank">itch.io devlog</a>. Enjoy!

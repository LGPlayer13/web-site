        <p>good morning, cherished lg product consumers. today i bring you a super rad <b>devlog</b>! yeah so i'm pretty much using these things as a way to <i>not</i> write depressing stuff, instead focusing on my projects. despite what the past 3 blog posts have led you to believe, i'm still capable of being productive and making funny stuff (allegedly). if i make another Daydreaming or Worrywort-like post again, i think we'll both lose it. so let's try something less dreary this time, yeah?</p>
        <p>remember that showcase or whatever i mentioned last time? or the time before that? yeah, that's still happening, surprisingly! all the voicelines and footage are good to go, just gotta keep the editing going. i've had a decent bit of fun writing and voicing the video, since i <i>rarely</i> do these. you could say this is my first one, since anything before this was just some gameplay with text and music slapped on it. i dunno how long this thing will turn out, but i doubt it'll be anything higher than 10 minutes. i also plan for the video to have captions, because i'm such a nice guy and people can't watch <i>anything</i> without captions nowadays.</p>
        <p>i'm <b>considering</b> releasing a demo of George 1.5 after the showcase releases, but i have mixed feelings about it. one one hand, a demo would give people some long-awaited clarity after George 2 closed its doors. maybe it could even spark (very minor) interest in the game again! but on the other hand, demos are getting tiring. my last few big projects have been nothing but demos and short teasers, with no real progress being made. the few people who've stuck around are probably sick of these terribly unfinished builds of my games. i doubt people will be raving about the <i>third George 2 demo</i> in a row.<br>that's why i'm only considering releasing a demo. if i did, it'd contain the first level, boss, and maybe some cutscenes or other hidden stuff. now that i think about it, there was a <i>previous</i> G1.5 demo planned, which i called the Early Experience. it was more of a prequel to the game, taking place in a level that's entirely in George's head. there were a couple neat ideas and mechanics in that build, and now i just wanna grab them and stuff 'em in the actual game. hopefully that'll give me some motivation, which is something i've greatly lacked in the past 3 years.</p>

        <p>well, that was fun. but you know what's also fun? music. that's right- today i'm talking about R- <i>i mean <a href="https://lgplayer13.bandcamp.com/album/fragments-of-waves" target="_blank">my new album</a>!!</i> yes! the new album! my album, not... anyone else's. so... background. do you remember listening to The S? no? then great! no one remembers listening to that album, and for good reason. <b>it was bad.</b> looking back half a year later, that album was bloated, messy, and practically unfinished. i never went back to any tracks, or ever fledged out any ideas. i just went from one song to another, never giving it a second thought.<br>so forget about the The S. Thirteen also isn't that important. let's look at my newest release, Fragments of Waves. firstly, the cover art. i made it in 20 minutes, so make of that what you will. secondly, the music itself. there's 11 tracks on this thing, making it 40 minutes- wait, <i>40 minutes</i> long?! well, i guess those 5, 6, and even 7 minute tracks don't add up to nothing. 11 tracks is a good middle ground between too short and too bloated. it's not terribly long, but still gives you a solid amount of material to work with. sure, the overall length might leave a lot less to be desired, but too bad.</p>
        <p>the album as a whole took about ~5 weeks, with only the 1st and 4th being really productive. two of the songs are actually singles i released last fall, but decided to slap onto this project. do they fit? probably not, but i like them enough to bring 'em aboard. there was another single, Magnesium Tire, that was released afterward, although it's a bit different from the album version. that might sound annoying, but i did a similar thing with Parade Features from my last album. not that it makes it any better, but it's something i've done before.<br>so why am i promoting an album that's probably only average at best? well... because i'm... proud of it? i guess?? i don't really do too much these days, especially with my cool games, unfortunately. music-making is a... passable way to do something with my life. plus, it gives me an excuse to write a rather short devlog about it! i had a decent bit of fun writing the songs too, even if not all of them are great. trust me, i had that same mindset for the last two albums.</p>
        <p>anyways, feel free to listen to the album if you'd like. seriously, it's a <i>lot</i> less grating compared to The S. probably not the best look to insult my own projects, but there <i>was</i> a point in time where i was proud of it. i've moved past it, like i'm sure most people do with their old projects. who knows, maybe i'll find a way to get these things onto Spotify. i mean, you'd probably catch me and ONLY me listening to them, but i wouldn't really care who listens to these. i'm happy with them and that's that. and if you <i>do</i> listen to Fragments of Waves... let me know what you think. tell me your favorite and least favorite song, and tell me that one song you just absolutely despise for no reason.</p>

        <p>welp, that wraps up this devlog. i know these are pretty dang short compared to the ginormous blog posts, but at least these aren't sad! with that being said, have a good one, and i'll actually try to dial back the depression next month.

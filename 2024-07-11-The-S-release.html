That project also helped me get used to Deflemask and learn some more neat things about it.<br><br>This new release, ironically, contains 13 new tracks. No bonus tracks this time, but you're getting 14 extra minutes of music to listen to! A couple of the tracks are decently long, with one of them even being <b>six whole minutes</b>. Yeah, this might be a bit much for an under-produced Sega Genesis album, but I don't care. You should listen to it at some point, preferably with earmuffs for added comfort.<br>I can't remember exactly how long this album took me to make, but I know that the covers for it and the singles were taken on July 4th. The old covers look abysmal compared to these new ones. I even used GIMP with no prior help to add some filters and text to them.<br><br>Well I gotta eat breakfast at <i>some</i> point, so that's it for today. Enjoy what I've made, thanks. <a href="https://lgplayer13.bandcamp.com/album/the-s">Here's the link to the album.</a></p>

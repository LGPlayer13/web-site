          <summary><b>GENERAL QUESTIONS</b></summary>
          <p style="margin-top:5px;"><b>Q : How can I support you?</b><br>A : I'm unfortunately too young to have a PayPal or something like that, so I dunno. Subscribe to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LGPlayer13">Youtube channel</a> or check out my other socials. Play a game or two. Maybe listen to some of my songs, despite their apparent lack in quality.<br><br><b>Q : I like your art. Do you do commissions?</b><br>A : Nope. If you're that desperate for my artwork, draw something better. Literally everyone draws my characters better than I can, lol. My résumé of art can be found in the <a href="art-gallery">Art Gallery</a> page.<br><br><b>Q : How can I check for new releases and updates?</b><br>A : Well, you've already gotten to my web site, so I'd say you're in a good place for that.<br><br><b>Q : How can I contact you?</b><br>A : Join my <a href="https://discord.gg/v7NaVBTwnD">Discord server</a> and shoot me a message. You can also sign my <a href="https://lgplayer13.atabook.org/">guestbook</a>.<br><br><b>Q : Where are the secrets?</b><br>A : I forgot, although I <i>do</i> know they're kept in a folder called "secrets".</p>

          <summary style="animation-delay:0.03s;"><b>EVEN MORE ABOUT ME</b></summary>
          <p style="margin-top:5px;"><b>Q : How old are you?</b><br>A : 15. I've already revealed it before, so there's no point in putting '15-17' or something like that.<br><br><b>Q : Any nicknames you go by?</b><br>A : Typically, I just go by LG. I don't care if you make <a href="https://www.lg.com/">Life's Good</a> jokes.<br><br><b>Q : When did you start making stuff online?</b><br>A : I "discovered" Scratch back in 2019, but I brushed it off for not being "real coding". A year later (during the pandemic), I revisited Scratch and found it to be quite the neat tool. Ever since then, I've been making neat games on there. As for IGM, I started making a bunch of crappy, now-deleted clicker games back in 2019, until I lost interest and stopped. Then in 2022, I picked up coding in IGM again and started making actually decent games.<br><br><b>Q : Any hobbies other than coding?</b><br>A : I like collecting plushies in my spare time, albeit most of them are Minecraft mobs. However, I do have some other ones, such as Greg from Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Ross Federman, Tally Hall's drummer. I also collect CDs every now and then, since I love them and the music inside them.</p>

          <summary style="animation-delay:0.06s;"><b>THE WEB SITE</b></summary>
          <p style="margin-top:5px;"><b>Q : How did you make this web site?</b><br>A : I use <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> for hosting, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a> for the repo, and <a href="https://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> for coding. Originally I used GitHub's built-in editor for making it, until I realized how much time I was wasting. I often refer to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> for tutorials and guidance.<br><br><b>Q : What's with the whole GitHub/Neocities hosting switch?</b><br>A : When the site was created, it was hosted on Neocities. Then a couple months later, I abandoned it in favor of GitHub Pages. But after months of consistent updates and pondering, this site officially moved back to Neocities.<br><br><b>Q : You're telling me you DIDN'T use a layout builder?</b><br>A : You're correct! I didn't use one because I thought it'd be more fun making an entire website straight from scratch, especially considering my affiliation with CSS through <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/">IGM</a>. It actually ended up working out, surprisingly.<br><br><b>Q : What's with the version number? Shouldn't those just be for games?</b><br>A : Ever since I started making games back in 2019, I've always been obsessed with version numbers. Whether it's formatted X.Y or X.Y.Z, I'm all for it. (1-digit numbers are a no-go, though.)<br><br><b>Q : What's with the space between <i>web</i> and <i>site</i>?</b><br>A : I faintly remember making a typo during the early days of the site, that being an accidental space in the word 'website'. I thought it'd be funny to just roll with it, and it's stuck ever since.<br><br><b>Q : When was this web site originally established?</b><br>A : April 13, 2023, so it's been a while. The now-defunct GitHub version was made on October 15, 2023.</p>

          <summary style="animation-delay:0.09s;"><b>MY GAMES / CHARACTERS</b></summary>
          <p style="margin-top:5px;"><b>Q : When did you come up with your characters?</b><br>A : I came up with George, Cory, and Greg in early 2021, and Sparky in mid 2021. The <a href="./games/sids-adventure">Sid's Adventure</a> characters were made in 2022 (one in mid 2023). My IGM games have no characters so far.<br><br><b>Q : Can I use your characters in my own games?</b><br>A : Go ahead! Just make sure to credit me.<br><br><b>Q : Can I make fanart of your characters?</b><br>A : Sure, just please don't make it weird.<br><br><b>Q : Can I record/stream myself playing your games or listening to your music?</b><br>A : Sure! (the latter is more of a joke, but go ahead if you'd like)</p>

      <p>i have a chemistry assignment due in an hour and a half please call it off for the love of all that is fine and dandy</p>
      <p>good evening- wait, wrong script. *ahem*, good morning. okay, i know i've been on a hot streak for the past... <i>3 months</i>, but these weekly blog posts are getting a little tiring. you might think a week gives me plenty of time to talk about mildly interesting things with minimal spelling mistakes, but that's not quite true. some weeks are just more eventful than others, and that's just kinda how it is. having to grasp and scramble for junk to write about each week gets repetitive and a little mind-numbing after a while, and it was even <i>worse</i> back when i wrote a post every... like, <b>two days</b><br>so i figured i might as well announce it now- <b>these weekly blog posts are limited.</b> eventually, i'll be making the switch to <i>montly blog posts</i>. if you're an avid reader of this blog and have kept up with site updates, it probably seems <i>really</i> annoying that i've been constantly updating and changing how the blog works. i've seen people use <a href="https://zonelets.net/">Zonelets</a> for blogging a lot, and it looks pretty useful. i'll most likely use that for the monthly blog posts, and i'll use some notepad doc for writing down ideas every week. does this mean blog posts will be longer? based on how much i'm writing now, yes</p>
      <p>so now that that's out of the way (man english is <i>weird</i>), i also wanna talk about this web site's new <b>halloween theme</b>! just underneath the sid theme in the list, there's a new <i>Spook</i> theme that features a dark background (on certain pages), a reddish-orange color palette, and a couple unique <i>icon variations</i>. it'll be available for a limited time until <b>November 11th</b>. and if you didn't notice, that date lines up with a blog post monday! (at least if these weekly posts are still around by then). i think the theme is pretty neat, and it's probably better than the Cory and Greg themes</p>
      <p>last weekend- well, yesterday, if that makes any sense whatsoever, i saw <b>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024)</b> with my parents. it's actually a <i>really good</i> movie, having that iconic Tim Burton-weirdness. compared to the first movie, this sequel is somehow even <i>weirder</i> than that movie, even containing some blood and gore, which is cool. very good movie, very good timing for release, good stuff all around</p>
      <p>i'm ending it here because dinner and/or homework, see you next week for some action</p>

      <p>i'm not the villain, choose someone else (you don't get to)</p>
      <p>hey everyone, guess what! so last week was uneventful. shocking news, i know. but some other cool-ish stuff happened while i was existing, and i think this here blog post is a great place to talk about that stuff. i don't talk about stuff very often, despite what certain areas of the web site want you to believe. so yes, i <i>am</i> going to talk about things today. no, this is not filler. it is an abstract puzzle of sorts. incoherent ramblings ensue</p>
      <p>so <b>Minecraft "Live"</b> happened recently. being a pre-recorded broadcast, this was mojang's yearly opportunity- wait, they're happening <i>twice a year</i> now?! well that explains the pitifully sad duration. anyways, what was actually... y'know, <i>announced</i> in this thing? ...i mean, it wasn't... <i>devoid</i> of news. obviously, the best part was the villager news segment, because it was the only life imbued into this shell of a minecraft event. mojang also announced a <b>new biome and mob</b>! introducing, the <i>cracking</i>! or... the <i>freaking</i>! or... whatever name they gave to that thing. the new pale garden biome is basically a dark oak biome but grayscaled. originality, i am right? at least the mob has a neat gimmick, even if the mob itself is completely useless<br>there was also a segment about the minecraft movie but i'm not gonna bother touching upon it in-depth. to sum the whole thing up, they get it <i>right</i>, but then get it <i>wrong</i>. thank you, movie execs</p>
      <p>another thing that happened is the release of the new <b>The Smile album</b>!! led by thom yorke (radiohead's frontman), this side-project of his now has 3 studio albums under its belt. this new release, <i>Cutouts</i>, contains 10 tracks that were recorded during the <i>Wall Of Eyes</i> sessions, and never made it into that album. to be honest, this album has a very <i>haunting</i> vibe to it, which is pretty fitting, considering that it's now le spooky month. overall, the release is probably their weakest release (but not by much!), yet it's still a good listen. it has quite a few bangers, but a tad bit of unfortunate filler in some areas. i'll give it a flat 8/10</p>
      <p>alright, it's time for the LG Productions-branded <i>School Segment</i>! how exciting, yeah!!1!1! today was a weird day, because we had <i>every class</i> today. to most kids in school, that probably seems extremely... normal. but my school works on a 4-block schedule, so this was a terrible change of pace. having every class in one day is just a hassle, and it doesn't help that we only get <i>one break</i> instead of the usual two. this week is also the school's pep week, where the students get to dress up for a bunch of ""unique"" themes. today's theme was actually pretty good, mainly because it was "wear your favorite band" day and i got to wear my Vampire Weekend shirt. tomorrow is the "aloha" theme, which they do <i>every. single. year</i></p>
      <p>that's it from me, i will see you all when i get the sudden urge to write next monday<br>oh yeah the <a href="Games">Games</a> page got updated, go crazy</p>

      <p>this song was (briefly) featured in brooklyn nine-nine and i'm not even kidding</p>
      <p>morning everyone. we got the day off today, so that means i'm still at my house! last week was still relatively uneventful, or maybe it wasn't and i just forgot everything that happened. y'know, i should probably start taking note of important and/or notable events that happen. well, i guess i'll go through what i <i>can</i> remember. after all, i assume you're here to read up about how my life is going (or you're just really bored)</p>
      <p>my school held its <i>club rush</i> last wednesday, and we got an astonishing <b>15 whole minutes</b> to look at the... <i>31 clubs</i>!? last year there were like, 20! anyways, there was a wide range of clubs, from topics like cats and cookies, different cultures and languages, to whatever the cologne club is. i ended up joining the drama club since i'm now part of the fall production (fancy name for "the play"). my mom recommended i join the movie club, and i'm honestly considering, especially since they're gonna be watching some bangers like shrek 2 and coraline</p>
      <p>remember how during my freshman year, i always ranted about being sad and lonely? well, i think that's (<i>thankfully</i>) starting to wear thin, mainly because i've started hanging out with a group of kids that one of the kids from the play rehearsals introduced me to. wow, that sentence feels <i>incredibly</i> awkward and long. so yeah, these guys are goofy and pretty nice, and they also frequently throw things at each other. i also talked to a couple other kids from the rehearsals, and we had a pretty sincere convo about how i could possibly make more friends and become less introverted. things are looking better at school, for once</p>
      <p>so now as i'm writing this, some hyphenated man is questioning whether or not this blog post is actually real or not, and i'd like to get this thing out so i can... y'know, <i>show him</i>. although i wanna talk about one more thing before i depart for the week</p>
      <p>i plan to make the George 1R v1.1 trailer <i>very soon</i>. the update's nearing completion, and i only have a couple issues left to tidy up. no, this isn't gonna be a Scratch trailer, this will be a <b>Youtube trailer</b>. with like, <i>actual</i> editing. i'll probably look bad and janky, but it will certainly exist. this update is packed with features, changes, and fixes/optimizations, making the game 27% more playable. also, i love getting unfortunately distracted and now i completely forgot what i was gonna talk about. oh yeah, the end of this post</p>
      <p>have a nice day, have a good one, have a good day, have a day, the day was have'd</p>

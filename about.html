        Heyo, this is LG. I like to make dinky projects on Scratch and IGM, play dumb video games, and rant about stuff. (you probably knew that.)<hr>In my spare time, I collect plushies and CDs alongside being lazy.<br>I also listen to music. A LOT of music.<br><br>My favorite project I've started has to be the George Series. Sure, it only contains one entry, but there's more in the works!

        <section>Like I mentioned earlier, I collect plushies!

        <section>Another hobby of mine is collecting CDs! Shocker, I know, coming from the guy who doesn't shut up about his "niche" taste in music.<br><br>Most of the CDs I have right now are just from my parents' collections, but I have quite a few of my own.<br>These two Grizzly Bear CDs you see are probably my favorites out of the bunch.</section>

            <summary><b>General</b></summary>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Q : How can I support you?</b><br>A : I'm unfortunately too young to have a PayPal or something like that, so I dunno. Subscribe to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LGPlayer13" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a> or check out my other socials.</li>
              <li><b>Q : I like your art. Do you do commissions?</b><br>A : Nope. If you're that desperate for my artwork, draw something better. Literally everyone draws my characters better than I can, lol.</li>
              <li><b>Q : How can I check for new releases and updates?</b><br>A : Well, you've already gotten to my web site, so I'd say you're in a good place for that.</li>
              <li><b>Q : How can I contact you?</b><br>A : Join my <a href="https://discord.gg/v7NaVBTwnD" target="_blank">Discord server</a> and shoot me a message. You can also sign my <a href="https://lgplayer13.atabook.org/">guestbook</a>.</li>
              <li><b>Q : Where are the secrets?</b><br>A : I forgot, although I <i>do</i> know they're kept in a folder called "secrets".</li>

            <summary><b>More About Me</b></summary>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Q : How old are you?</b><br>A : Between the ages of 15-18. My actual age is already out there, I just don't wanna update this every year.</li>
              <li><b>Q : Any nicknames you go by?</b><br>A : Typically, I just go by LG. I don't care if you make <a href="https://www.lg.com/" target="_blank">Life's Good</a> jokes.</li>
              <li><b>Q : When did you start making stuff online?</b><br>A : I "discovered" Scratch back in 2019, but I brushed it off for not being "real coding". A year later (during the pandemic), I revisited Scratch and found it to be quite the neat tool. Ever since then, I've been making neat games on there. As for IGM, I started making a bunch of crappy, now-deleted clicker games back in 2019, until I lost interest and stopped. Then in 2022, I picked up coding in IGM again and started making actually decent games.</li>
              <li><b>Q : Any hobbies other than coding?</b><br>A : Look at the clear boxes up there.</li>

            <summary><b>Web Site</b></summary>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Q : How did you make this web site?</b><br>A : I use <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a> for hosting, <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for the repo, and <a href="https://phcode.io/#/home" target="_blank">Phoenix Code</a> for coding.</li>
              <li><b>Q : Any external resources you use?</b><br>A : I also use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> for HTML/CSS tutorials, <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> for image editing, and <a href="https://optipng.sourceforge.net/">optiPNG</a> for image compression.</li>
              <li><b>Q : You're telling me you DIDN'T use a layout builder?</b><br>A : You're correct! I didn't use one because I thought it'd be more fun making an entire website straight from scratch, especially considering my affiliation with CSS through <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/" target="_blank">IGM</a>. It actually ended up working out, surprisingly.</li>
              <li><b>Q : What's with the version number? Shouldn't those just be for games?</b><br>A : Ever since I started making games back in 2019, I've always been obsessed with version numbers. Whether it's formatted X.Y or X.Y.Z, I'm all for it. (1-digit numbers are no good, though.)</li>
              <li><b>Q : What's with the space between <i>web</i> and <i>site</i>?</b><br>A : I faintly remember making a typo during the early days of the site, which was an accidental space in the word 'website'. I thought it'd be funny to just roll with it, and it's stuck ever since.</li>
              <li><b>Q : When was this web site originally established?</b><br>A : April 13, 2023, so it's been a while. The now-defunct GitHub Pages version was made on October 15, 2023.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Q : When did you come up with your characters?</b><br>A : I came up with George, Cory, and Greg in early 2021, and Sparky in mid 2021. The <a href="/games/sids-adventure">Sid's Adventure</a> characters were made in 2022 (one in mid 2023). My IGM games have no real characters so far.</li>
              <li><b>Q : Can I use your characters in my own games?</b><br>A : Go ahead! Just make sure to credit me.</li>
              <li><b>Q : Can I make fanart of your characters?</b><br>A : Sure, just please don't make it weird.</li>
              <li><b>Q : Can I record/stream myself playing your games or listening to your music?</b><br>A : Sure! (the latter is more of a joke, but go ahead if you'd like)</li>

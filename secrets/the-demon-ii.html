      <h3>Page 1</h3>George and the Daily Dose of Poisoning [Revision 2]<br>by LG
      <h3>Page 2</h3>chapter 1 : the man<br>George was on his way to Cory's Thrift Music Emporium Drug Store Shop when he heard a suspicious noise coming from a man.<br>This man had a goatee and dwarfism.
      <h3>Page 3</h3>"What's that noise coming out of your ass?" asked George.<br>"That would be my stomach, Mr. Triangle," the man replied.<br>George glanced at the man and saw one of his kidneys pumping vigorously inside him.
      <h3>Page 4</h3>"You good?" asked George in a worried tone.<br>"Sure I am. In fact, I forgot to take a couple of my pills this morning. Or was it the fish hooks I ate instead?" said the man.<br>"Sh*t," said George.
      <h3>Page 5</h3>Unexpected and unfortunate events pursued.<br>The man flopped onto the ground and started spitting out the butterflies he'd somehow eaten for breakfast earlier.<br>Did I mention the man was 157 years old?
      <h3>Page 6</h3>Geirge wondered how the man was still breathing, and he sought to end it.<br>Remembering what happened last month, he looked for some of his Fried Rice.<br>Apparently, he ate it while jumping off a cliff or some sh*t.
      <h3>Page 7</h3>chapter 2 : the demon<br>Suddently, the Demon of Withering appeared from the depths of 111. He grinned at the small triangle and said the many harsh words.<br>"Good afternoon, dumb triangle. Wanna go to the Radical Caves?"
      <h3>Page 8</h3>The Demon waited for a response while the man ate a couple more fish hooks.<br>George also enslaved Lex to harvest his bees' honey. He wasn't after blood, he was after mead.<br>"No thanks, I am mead today," replied George.
      <h3>Page 9</h3>This was not the answer the Demon was hoping for.<br>He got out his (slightly less fat) scythe and started to threaten the small triangle.<br>George proceeded to build an Aether Portal, asking the Demon to do him a favor.
      <h3>Page 10</h3>The Demon agreed to help with this favor, stepping into the portal.<br>He was then banished into a loop of forever fighting the Valkyries.<br>George ate Lex and Opal for breakfast, feeling happy. It was a fine day.
      <h3>Page 11</h3>chapter 3 : the lemon<br>The man was still lying on the ground, wishing for some nutritious mead.<br>He was glad the small triangle was finally gone.<br>This all changed when the Demon of Poisoning appeared.
      <h3>Page 12</h3>This particular Demon was lactose intolerant, which basically means any form of dairy both tastes and feels like sh*t. Good stuff.<br>George returned to the man and asked him for some beans.<br>The man only had two, but they were off limits.
      <h3>Page 13</h3>The new Demon walked up to the small triangle with a smile.<br>"Good afternoon, kind sir. Do you have any funny Holystone?"<br>"I ate all of mine, for I am not a very good Christian," said George.
      <h3>Page 14</h3>The new Demon was furious. The funny Holystone was his to eat, for he was pretty unholy.<br>George then received a call from Lex, who was being eaten for breakfast by Opal.<br>He warned him of the new Demon's powers.
      <h3>Page 15</h3>"Uh oh," said George.<br>The new Demon revealed himself as the lead actor of Stranger Things,<br>and he struck the small triangle with his goofy ass spellbook, giving the Poisoning effect to him.<br>Ouchie ouch sh*t no way dawg
      <h3>Page 16</h3>The original Demon broke free of his Valkyrie-related curse and threw some mystery milk at the new Demon.<br>The new Demon screamed the many screams of screamers,<br>and Lex became a Culver's Butter Burger.
      <h3>Page 17</h3>George then went home, for he'd left his toothpaste in his pillowcase.<br>Cory often asked why it was there.<br>George was later arrested for 96 individual stabbings of homeless people.
      <h3>Page 18</h3>The two Demons fought for a while over who could eat Lex for breakfast the best.<br>Lex was in a great deal of pain for many years to come.<br>thesb ehed n

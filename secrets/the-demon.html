      <h3>Page 1</h3>George and the Daily Dose of Withering<br>by LG
      <h3>Page 2</h3>George was a triangle who encountered the Demon of Withering.<br>The demon told him: "Wanna explore the radical caves?"<br>George replied: "Nah"
      <h3>Page 3</h3>The Demon was upset by this news, so he got out his fat scythe, threatening to hurt the small triangle.<br>George was unphased by this unpleasant news, as he had plenty of Fried Rice.<br>He said: "f***"
      <h3>Page 4</h3>He was then brutally struck by the scythe, and the Withering effect was given to him.<br>It was painful, and his many hearts turned black.<br>"Ouchie ouch f***ie f*** sh*t dogwater"
      <h3>Page 5</h3>Multiple Fried Rice were consumed, and the Withering faded away after 45 seconds.<br>Oh boy, this is not good news today.<br>This is just so sad, and Lex was consumed by the Demon right after.
      <h3>Page 6</h3>After the effect faded away, George became super duper angeryry.<br>He pulled out his diamond sword looking thing and stabbed the Demon.<br>Demon said: "Why do you do so much damage?"
      <h3>Page 7</h3>The angryry triangle responded: "I am become death, destryoter of words."<br>He pulled out a big word and smacked the Demon with it.<br>Lex gave a big "hooray!!!"<br>THe eend.

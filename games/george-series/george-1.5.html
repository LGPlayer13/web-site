                    <p>Months after the original George 1 was released, work on George 2 began. Inspired by a multitude of other Scratch platformers, it was slated to release mid-late 2022. However, those plans eventually fell through.<br><br>After going through four engines in total, I decided to scrap George 2 and start a new "in-between" chapter of the series. Its story is much more fleshed out and well-written than its predecessor's, and the gameplay is <i>much</i> more smooth and stable.</p>

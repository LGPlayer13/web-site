      <p>one week of summer left. i'm super excited for what comes next</p>
      <p>it's been a decent summer, but unfortunately all good things come to an unfortunate end. now that i've gotten all my books and ""fixed"" my schedule, i'm ""ready"" for my next year of high school. however, there's still more school-related bullsh*t that i've had to deal with. first off, the school promised they'd be providing their own chromebooks for students to use. however, <b>they're delayed</b>, because of course they are. i don't know what clown decided to have this place provide their own chromebooks, especially considering students would almost immediately start finding loopholes and hack the hell out of those things. but it gets even better.<br>while not directly relating to <i>my</i> class, another crucial object has been delayed- the freshman locks. just like last year, the freshman class has to wait longer before being able to use the damn lockers. things just always seem to go consistently <b>wrong</b> when it comes to the beginning of school, and it looks like it's just getting worse. thanks, school</p>
      <p>secondly, my parents are actively forcing me to get and use an instagram account. if you know <i>anything</i> about my generation, social media is like an addiction, and it's arguably worse than actual drugs. because my first year was so sh*t and i was depressingly lonely, my parents (mainly my mom) think that making me get an instagram account is a great idea for curing my crippling isolation. even though i've <b>actively expressed</b> my distaste for social media (discord doesn't count), they are entirely disregarding my wishes and making me get it. i don't think a singular, garbage app is going to do <i>anything</i> for me. if i want to make friends, i'd actually want to TALK to them, not message them three times and completely forget they exist.<br>my parents said they'd have a mindset of "we'll let him make the choices he wants to make" going into high school, but it's great knowing they've already forgotten about that. they think <i>i'm</i> the stubborn one for not wanting the stupid app, but they're being complete hypocrites. i've told them before that i just <i>don't</i> connect with my generation- i'm the complete opposite. i don't like social media, i don't play sports, and i don't listen to trendy music. (it sucks ass.) this generation as a whole just sucks for a guy like me. what a time to be alive.<br>also, the only things the kids at my school do is either fight, gossip, or make out and film videos of them doing it. not very exciting.<br>also also, <b>my parents have been on social media more in a month than i've ever been in my entire life!</b></p>
      <p>man, i've gotten so pissed off that i honestly considered making this a <a style="color:#ec4747;">red</a> post. i'm <i>really</i> trying to be somewhat enthusiastic for this upcoming school year, but everything that's come before it has been such a sh*tshow that i'm fully unable to even have an iota of excitement. it's not looking good</p>
      <p>i'm ending it here. i need to eat some lunch and try to find <i>any</i> positives i can look forward to. goodbye, and sorry for the long rant<br><q style="font-size:14px;color:#202020;">psst! i'm working on a teaser trailer for george 1.5, please hang tight</q></p>

      <p>looks like life got lazy and just copy+pasted my freshman year as my sophomore year. hope this changes soon</p>
      <p>high. the school has started, and i'll actually try to <i>not</i> rant about it this time. all i'll say is that literally <i>nothing</i> has changed from last year. you might as well compare a day from last year and compare it to today- it looks identical. (apart from the new classes and all that.) however, i've already signed up for debate club and plan on trying out for some other stuffs, so i guess i'll just have to play it by ear</p>
      <p>anyways... back to my games and such. <b>i released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liTOlih09SA">gameplay trailer</a> for George 1.5!</b> it's not the most interesting thing in the world, but it does show what the game looks like and how some mechanics function. more teaser videos and announcements will come soon, but <i>progress is indeed being made</i>! as for my other projects, i'll have to see when i'm actually motivated to work on those again. i'll probably work on Fire Forge alongside G1.5, but it might take longer to get a trailer out for that game. until then, enjoy this 1.7-minute trailer for the next George Series game. <s>it only took 3 years</s></p>
      <p>summer break as a whole was fairly decent. i went to the beach, went to a theme park (twice), and managed to release something i'm actually proud of. i get it's a terribly low bar to cross, but i've been so bummed out and moody lately that i'm finding it increasingly difficult to do anything productive. can't wait until the homework starts piling up. i <i>really</i> wish i would've accomplished more stuff before it ended, but at least i got <i>something</i> done. the next few blogs are probably going to be as short as this one, mainly because my schedule is going to be a lot of "school, home, school, home, etc." and nothing really worth talking about</p>
      <p>that's it for now. hope i can fix my crippling loneliness sometime. cya</p>

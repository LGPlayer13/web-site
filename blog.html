      <p>apparently this word doesn't exist, but it's actually a song for a game that goes hard</p>
      <p>welp, i've done it. that's right- i've officially gotten a new chair for my room. it's this sweet purple/black chair from IKEA that cost around $350. the old one i had was about to fall apart, and it basically already had. this new one is much more sturdy and is pretty damn comfortable, and it even has a reclining feature i didn't even notice before buying it. wait a minute, this wasn't what i had planned to talk about</p>
      <p>so i should probably explain the elephant in the room- <b>this web site's new look</b>! after just a couple days of coding and experimenting, this site has officially updated to version 2.0. every single page (that was kept, at least) has received a complete overhaul and a fresh new layout. my favorite by far is the <a href="https://lgplayer13.neocities.org/about">About</a> page, as i just love how it turned out, especially with the icons of george and cory being the cherry on top. i'm really happy with how it turned out, as i'd been a bit unhappy with the previous design for a couple months up until now<br>i should probably also mention the <i>other</i> elephant in the room, that being <b>the official switch back to Neocities</b>! yeah, this web site used to be hosted on Neocities, until i switched to the GitHub Pages version a couple months after making it. this was before i knew about Git Hooks and all that, but i did some tinkering with the command line and Git to make this entire switch possible. i want to thank <a href="https://cohost.org/ChaiaEran/post/2755172-how-to-make-using-ne">this post</a> for showing how it was possible to do this</p>
      <p>in other news, me and my dad recently went to my school to pick up my new schedule for the year. however, there was one error- my elective class was shown as Digital Photography instead of the one i actually wanted, Web Design. i didn't even pick photography as one of my alternatives, and to add insult to injury, <i>i didn't even meet the prerequisites for that class</i>! after my dad and i laughed about it in a café we were at, i emailed my counselor when we got home to tell her about the issue. she informed me that web design <i>was</i> available, but it, unfortunately, was at the same period as my Honors World History class. so i asked her if i could take regular WH instead to take WD, but then she told me about <i>another</i> problem<br>you see, web design is a one-semester course, and the way it usually works is that you take it the first semester, and then take Game Design the second semester. but apparently, game design was <b>unavailable</b> this year (no reason was given), and the <i>only</i> other one-semester elective i could take to fill that gap was Literature of Sport, which... i mean who the hell would actually want to take that</p>
      <p>so i decided to ask her if could take one of my alternative electives, Journalism. she recommended i take Art I instead, as "it would meet the prequisites for a lot of the classes i want to take", even though <i>i don't even know what classes i wanna take next year</i>. so i told her i wanted to take journalism instead, and i FINALLY got my finished schedule. that was a lot more of a hassle than it should've been. thanks, school</p>
      <p>well other than that, my week was pretty uneventful. other than everything i just said, i just went to my grandparents' house yesterday for breakfast, which was nice. i guess that wraps up this post, and i'll end it off by saying that SMS '24 will be releasing within the next few days, as all i have left to do is make some more pixel art. cya</p>

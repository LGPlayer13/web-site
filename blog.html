      <p>that's another red flag, red flag</p>
      <p>good morning everyone. oh look, it's <i>actually</i> morning this time. that's crazy. surprisingly, i'm not as tired as i usually am in the morning, probably because it's labor day and we all get the day off, which is pretty sweet. i'll be honoring this laborious day (i don't think that's the correct adjective) by watching some youtube videos or something, idk</p>
      <p>so i know i <i>said</i> i'd be working on my games "a lot more", and <i>i have</i>, don't get me wrong. but if you have a keen eye for front pages, you might've noticed that second album. that's because i released- you guessed it, <i>another album</i>! this time it's a B-sides of sorts of The S, being aptly titled <b>The S (Remixes)</b>. go check it out if you want, and see what it has to offer.<br>anyways, back to what i'm known for (i think). i've been eyeing <b>Super Scratch Melee: Blitz</b>, my previous project before George 1.5, a lot recently. it's a decently fun game, but i abandoned it entirely after shutting down George 2 for its much better, much more polished half-brother. SSMB has only 9 fighters right now, and it was planned to have around 18 or so before release. unfortunately, those last 9 fighters were never implemented, even though i've already settled on the majority of the base roster. i would love to come back to the game, but sadly, it's further down on my agenda. for now you can just play its <a href="./games/super-scratch-melee">predecessor</a>, even though it's... fairly bad</p>
      <p>for some reason, i've been listening to a certain song <i>a lot</i> recently. if you, for whatever odd reason, pay attention to my scrobbles on last.fm, you'll probably see that i've listened to <b>zero sum</b> over <i>20 times</i>. why? because it's a very song, and you should listen to said song. i've found myself listening to the smile a lot more than radiohead recently, most likely because i'm not depressed, but i still want some radiohead<i>-esque</i> music going through my eardrums. i've also been listening to nine inch nails as of recent. actually, does listening to <i>one song</i> count as listening to an entire band? probably not</p>
      <p>as for irl stuff that's going on, my cousin-in-law was supposed to host a barbeque for her birthday yesterday, but the way it was set up and planned out was quite confusing. when i first heard about it last friday, it said the bbq was being held <i>today</i> (monday). but a day later, my mom said it was being held on <i>sunday</i>. okay then. but <i>then</i>, sunday rolled around, and my mom told me it was rescheduled to 4 pm instead of 1 pm. okay... then? but <i style="font-weight:bold">then</i>, a couple hours later, it got straight-up canceled. so that's nice. my parents and i went out to chili's later though, so it was all fine and dandy</p>
      <p>so you remember how i said i was joining a debate club and/or team two weeks ago? well, guess what! <i>i dropped out!</i> after attending the first meeting, i found out how underprepared and how unviting the atmosphere was. firstly, two of the like, 8 or 9 kids were no-shows. despite the instructor brushing it off, i was thinking it didn't exactly bode well.<br>secondly, we had an introductory assignment to research and complete before the meeting started, an "easy, fun topic" to get us started, as the instructor described it. we had to write reasons for why we support and don't support pineapple on pizza for this little "intro debate" we were gonna have. so, it being an "easy, fun topic", i wrote a couple sentences and left it at that. well, when the intro debate got started, i realized that everyone else had written like, <i>3 paragraphs</i> each. like jesus, is everyone here a goddamn tryhard? i get they all have had experience, but for an "easy, fun topic", they made it seem like some college-level sh*t. we also had to critique each others' points, so it was fun sitting there and hearing them say crap like "i like how he got to the point"</p>
      <p>welp, that's it for today. see you all next week when i inevitably make The S 2</p>

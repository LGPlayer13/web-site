      <p>This is the <b>Blog</b> page. New posts are written every Monday. (usually)<br><b><a style="color:#bdec47;">Green</a></b> posts are normal topics, <b><a style="color:#477fec;">blue</a></b> posts are deep topics, <b><a style="color:#ec4747;">red</a></b> posts are angry rants, and <b><a style="color:#47ecae;">midway</a></b> posts are unique.</p>

      <p>be sure to watch your step, as you can't look back once you've arrived</p>
      <p>alright, so <i>before</i> i talk about what i'd like to talk about today, i should probably explain what these new-fangled <a style="color:#47ecae;">midway</a> posts are. occasionally, a topic that i <i>really</i> want to discuss will come out, and i may not want to wait until the next weekly blog post to rant about it. that's what these <b>turquoise-colored</b> posts are for! they'll be much more uncommon than the usual <a style="color:#bdec47;">green</a> posts, but don't quote me on that</p>
      <p>anyways, this midway post is focusing on the- or should i say, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY">A Minecraft Movie</a>" teaser trailer. released two days ago, it (unsurprisingly) reached #1 on trending for around two days straight. however, the reception was terrible. and i mean <i>terrible</i>. as of writing this, it has (reportedly) <b>1+ million</b> dislikes, compared to its 550k likes. ouch. i myself am one of those dislikes, and it <i>really</i> hurts, man. being the world's 27th biggest minecraft fan, i was pretty excited when i first heard the movie was <i>actually</i> being made. but once the leaks came out, it all went to sh*t</p>
      <p>the movie looks... well, to be blunt with you, it looks absolutely, <i>unbearably</i> atrocious. yes, my MAIN problem with this movie is the artstyle. i don't know <i>who</i> thought that f***ing MINECRAFT would translate well to "not-entirely-realistic CGI with humans awkwardly shoved in", but that decision apparently made it all the way to an official trailer. everything looks and feels off. from the humans being triple the size of the trees, to the pink sheep, to jack black being cast as """Steve""", nothing feels correct.<br>as for the plot, it's just an isekai. like, literally. the description of the trailer itself says that main characters "find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld". it's like marketing team is saying to the consumer, "don't worry, there are no original ideas here." not to mention the whole "i... am steve" line. such a powerful line, showing that jack black isn't actually jack black in a blue shirt. no no, he's <b>Steve</b>, and you <i>know</i> it.</p>
      <p>overall, the trailer looks like ass, and everyone should apologize to story mode. cya</p>

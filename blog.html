      <p>i might end up having to tear this damn thing apart</p>
      <p>today has been relatively uneventful, aside from me trying to jailbreak my school chromebook. it all started this morning, during our second break. as i pulled up youtube, i saw an <i>advertisement</i> in the corner of my eye. as somewith with uBlock Origin (the best adblocker), this was shocking to see. i checked the extensions page only to find that <i>every extension was disabled</i>! even the ones i'd already installed! look, i get not wanting kids to install those 2048 or wordle extensions, but blocking <b>every single extension</b>?! that's no good.<br>when i got home, i started looking up how to jailbreak a chromebook. every article/website told me to enable developer mode, so i said okay. however, the key combination required to turn it on is <b class="textcode">ESC+Refresh+Power</b>, and the usual power button on chromebooks was replaced with a <i>lock button</i> on this particular model</p>
      <p>this led to a series of bing searches (yes, i use bing. i don't care) that led to me a variety of "solutions" that all relied on that fateful power button. after about an hour of searching, i was out of ideas. i checked the chromebook for any usb ports, and that's when i found an odd, glowing button on the side. <i>it was the power button, located on the side for no apparent reason!</i> after getting super psyched up to finally crack this thing, i activated recovery mode and navigated to the <b>enable developer mode</b> option, then pressed enter and waited. a couple seconds of waiting, a very loud <i>beep</i> came from... someplace on the chromebook. unfortunately for me, the screen displayed a message saying... developer mode had been <b>disabled</b>.<br>this was extremely disappointing news, so i exited recovery mode, let the system powerwash itself, then closed it. that about wraps up the <i>jailbroke arc</i>, and i'm not sure where to go from here. unless i can find a way to bypass the developer mode block, i'm stuck. how unfortunate</p>
      <p>well, that was neat, i guess. this would make for an amazing sponsor transition. anyhoo, aside from that arc i mentioned a few words ago, another mildly exciting thing happened at school today. to give me something to do during my non-existent schedule, i auditioned for my school's fall production last thursday. i had previously rehearsed some monologues the days leading up to it, so i felt prepared enough. after waiting in the performing arts center for two hours straight, it was my turn to head onto the stage. there were only two teachers there, which meant no students, thankfully. after giving it my all (or at least as much as i felt like giving in that moment), they said "thanks" and i... just headed home.<br>welp, later that evening, the callbacks were posted, and <i>my name</i> was on there. wowie! so i headed back to the same building the next day, and we all read a variety of scripts taken randomly from the actual play. i must've done <i>pretty dang well</i>, because guess what. <b>i'm in the play</b>, as a main character, no less. my parents and family were ecstatic about this news, and my mom even put some balloons on my door that somehow ended up jumpscaring me. christmas has come early for me</p>
      <p>as for game development, it has been happening. despite what the front page agenda wants you to believe, i'm worked on PLC (post-launch content) for <a href="./games/george-1r">George 1 Remastered</a>, the remaster of my smash-hit title, George the Jumping Triangle. it'll include 1 bonus level, 2 additional cutscenes, 2 new modes, along with a variety of QOL changes, here and there. i also plan to give the update its own <b>trailer</b> on youtube, so that'll be interesting to see when i get to it. until then, i'm sure my fan(s) can hardly contain their excitement</p>
      <p>that's it from me, see you all next week for even worse air quality</p>

      <p>school was quite the boring school, moving on now</p>
      <p>good morning everyone. i'm currently in one of those discord calls with some people. one of them is a demon, and the other one sucks at parkour. we're currently listening to minecraft parody music (along with some other garbage) as we somewhat patiently wait for one of the peoples to complete this parkour level. we were currently listening to <i>Fallen Kingdom</i>, and i had actually <i>never</i> listened to that song before. yeah, i've heard hits like "Don't Mine at Night" and "Creeper Rap", but i had somehow accidentally avoided hearing it for the longest time. and now i've heard it. hoo ray</p>
      <p>i've been working more and more on George 1.5 recently, just tidying things up, making minor engine/level improvements, and fixing some issues only i would notice. the game is <i>actually</i> being developed, not just sitting there idly on scratch's broken servers. i'll make another gameplay teaser video soon, maybe i'll show some parts of the cutscenes! i also revisited the fourth George 2 beta, and realized how absolutely bloated and atrocious it is. it's <i>probably</i> better than the third beta, but not by much</p>
      <p>i'm still in that vc i mentioned, except now it's down to three people, and we're no longer listening to minecraft parodies on loop. yay...? now we're just chatting about unmotivation, personality quizzes, and first names. decently uninteresting topics, i know.</p>
      <p>anyways, i've forgotten to share my thoughts on the new <b>foster the people</b> album! i listened to it a couple hours after it came out, and i'm extremely disappointed to report that i think the album is mid. this is such a tragic travesty. overall, the album has some great tunes, some forgettable ones, and straight-up garbage. the highlights include <i>See You In The Afterlife</i>, <i>Paradise State of Mind</i>, and <i>Chasing Low Vibrations</i><br>however, this album has a whole slew of bad/mid in it, including the masterpiece that is <i>Feed Me</i>. like man, this was supposed to be the album that i'd listen to and really enjoy to bring my sophomore year to a decent start, but it uhhh... missed. it missed big-time. oh well. at least vampire weekend and MGMT were able to bring out some bangers this year<br><q style="font-size:14px;color:#202020;">oh hey we reached 100 unique visitors, how crazy is that</q></p>

      <p>at the end of the trail there's another trail that's longer and goes around 20 more times</p>
      <p>good morning. i wonder how many times i've said that so far. someone count them for me. actually, i'll do it for you. including today's post, i've said "good morning" a total of <i>10 times</i>. that's crazy. anyways, last week was pretty boring. barely anything happened. the highlights were my play rehearsals, me eating bagels, and... going to BJ's restaurant. yeah, so this ends the streak of "long" blog posts. we had a good run going, i guess</p>
      <p>so this web site is currently in the middle of a <b>decently-sized</b> update, and it actually involves the <a href="blog-backlog">Blog Backlog</a>. since the changes made to it are so drastic, this means that <i>the previous blog post will be unavailable for a short while.</i> (if you're keen on page updates, you might've noticed the "top post" button is missing!) that leaves the singular button down there pretty lonely, and i'm not exactly sure what else i could put there. i suppose i'll just leave the button there by itself, but it feels wrong not having at least 2 buttons there</p>
      <p>this upcoming update also involves a few of the <a href="games">Games</a> sub-pages, specifically the ones for <i>George 1R</i>, <i>Sid's Adventure</i>, and the <i>IGM games</i>. instead of a game embed or a boring list of buttons, each of those pages will contain neat descriptions of what the game has to offer, even including some pictures of it to see! i'm very happy with how they look, but i just need to grab a few pictures for <i>The Lost Labyrinths</i> before it's ready to be pushed. (trust me, having to actually play your game to take pictures can take time)</p>
      <p>welp, i've basically run out of things to talk about. yeah, even with an <i>entire week</i> to do interesting things, i've still come up empty-handed for this blog post. i mean, what else is there to talk about? school? my crippling loneliness? my music taste? all of these topics are uninteresting and overused, so that pretty much wraps up this post. maybe next week i'll have more notable things to rant about? who knows for sure</p>
      <p>that's all i've got for today, goodbye for now</p>
